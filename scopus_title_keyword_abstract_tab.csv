Optimization scheme for intrusion detection scheme GBDT in edge computing center	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099874652&doi=10.1016%2fj.comcom.2020.12.007&partnerID=40&md5=81f6e1b48667c19851fbd65cfbb5cdea	Combination of edge computing technologies and machine learning help to put edge intelligence into practice. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is one of its most typical applications. But this system can be easily attacked in the process of using edge computing center to process localized perception data. Intrusion detection technologies based on machine learning provide strong security for edge computing center, in which the most widely used is gradient boosting decision tree (i.e., GBDT). But still this model faces with problems such as imbalanced data, high dimensional data characteristics, and low efficiency of parameter optimization. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an optimization scheme for GBDT to improve its detection precision and training efficiency. First, to solve the problem of imbalanced data in data set, we propose a margin synthetic minority oversampling technique (i.e., MSMOTE), which can expand the non-noise data with less sample size, namely, small sample, to ensure equilibrium distribution of data. Second, to lower the data feature dimensionality, we propose a recursive feature elimination-hierarchy cross validation algorithm (i.e., RFE-HCV). The new algorithm eliminates redundant data features recursively according to feature weight, to strengthen the relationship between features and goals. It also designs hierarchy system to ensure equal proportionment of data category (attack category) in training set and testing set at cross validation stage. Next, in order to improve the efficiency of parameter optimization in model training process, we develop a flexible grid search algorithm (i.e., FGS) to improve retrieval efficiency of optimum parameters. Finally, the detailed experimental results show that our new scheme ensures data balance in dataset and eliminates redundant data features, and helps the efficiency of parameter optimization increase by three times. Moreover, the new scheme defends against intrusion more effectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Ad Hoc Vehicular Fog Enabling Cooperative Low-Latency Intrusion Detection	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099123407&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3008488&partnerID=40&md5=0178d2e07e076ebba760330102ea8da8	Internet of Vehicles and vehicular networks have been compelling targets for malicious security attacks where several intrusion detection solutions have been proposed for protecting them. Nonetheless, their main problem lies in their heavy computation, which makes them unsuitable for next-generation artificial intelligence-powered self-driving vehicles whose computational power needs to be primarily reserved for real-time driving decisions. To address this challenge, several approaches have been lately presented to take advantage of the cloud computing for offloading intrusion detection tasks to central cloud servers, thus reducing storage and processing costs on vehicles. However, centralized cloud computing entails high latency on intrusion detection related data transmission and plays against its adoption in delay-critical intelligent applications. In this context, this article proposes a vehicular-edge computing (VEC) fog-enabled scheme allowing offloading intrusion detection tasks to federated vehicle nodes located within nearby formed ad hoc vehicular fog to be cooperatively executed with minimal latency. The problem has been formulated as a multiobjective optimization model and solved using a genetic algorithm maximizing offloading survivability in the presence of high mobility and minimizing computation execution time and energy consumption. Experiments performed on resource-constrained devices within actual ad hoc fog environment illustrate that our solution significantly reduces the execution time of the detection process while maximizing the offloading survivability under different real-life scenarios. © 2014 IEEE.

An ensemble learning and fog-cloud architecture-driven cyber-attack detection framework for IoMT networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097564138&doi=10.1016%2fj.comcom.2020.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=409ba8f7a79fa07267da7bd044eff556	Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), an application of Internet of Things (IoT), is addressing countless limitation of traditional health-care systems such as quality of patient care, healthcare costs, shortage of medical staff and inadequate medical supplies in an efficient manner. With the use of the IoMT systems, there are unparalleled benefits that are enhancing the quality and efficiency of treatments and thereby are improving patients health. However, the 2018 Ransomware cyber-attack on Indiana hospital system exposed the critical fault-lines among IoMT environment. The gravity and frequency of cyber-attacks are expanding at an alarming rate. Motivated from aforementioned challenges, we propose an ensemble learning and fog-cloud architecture-driven cyber-attack detection framework for IoMT networks. The ensemble design, combines Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest as first-level individual learners. In the next level, the classification results are used by XGBoost for identifying normal and attack instances. Second, for dynamic and heterogeneous networks such as IoMT, fog, and cloud, we present a deployment architecture for the proposed framework as, Software as a Service (SaaS) in fog side and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud side. Further, most of the existing work is evaluated using KDD CUP99 or NSL-KDD dataset. These datasets lack modern IoMT-based attacks. Therefore, the proposed model uses a realistic dataset namely, ToN-IoT which is collected from a heterogeneous and large-scale IoT network. The experimental result shows that the proposed framework can achieve detection rate of 99.98%, accuracy of 96.35%, and can reduce false alarm rate up to 5.59%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

P2IDF: A Privacy-Preserving based Intrusion Detection Framework for Software Defined Internet of Things-Fog (SDIoT-Fog)	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098869385&doi=10.1145%2f3427477.3429989&partnerID=40&md5=30e376fdfe5d676673d108a32e38ba38	The Software Defined Internet of Things-Fog (SDIoT-Fog) has provided a new connectivity paradigm for effective service provisioning. SDIoT-Fog uses network resource virtualization to provide services to heterogeneous IoT devices. However, data privacy, and security are the two major challenges that prevents faster realization of SDIoT-based frameworks. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we present a Privacy-Preserving based Intrusion Detection Framework (P2IDF) for protecting confidential data and to detect malicious instances in SDIoT-Fog network traffic. This framework has two key engines. Firstly, a Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-based privacy-preservation engine is suggested that transforms original data into a new encoded form that avoids inference attacks. Secondly, an intrusion detection engine is suggested that uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to train and evaluate the outcomes of the proposed privacy-preservation engine using an IoT-based dataset named ToN-IoT. Finally, experimental results showed that the proposed P2IDF framework outperforms with some recent state-of-The-Art frameworks in terms of detection rate, accuracy and precision score. © 2021 ACM.

Security and privacy issues in fog computing for healthcare 4.0	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090254661&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-46197-3_12&partnerID=40&md5=79e0e0f2da717f462b14ff11b8662e8e	Fog computing is a new trending technology which adds on the capability and efficiency to cloud computing network as it is interposed between cloud and device. Fog devices are able to compute large quantity of data locally, portable, and may be installed on heterogeneous system. It is significantly suitable for healthcare due to its real-time processing and event responses. Such huge variety of traits emerges new security and privacy issues. In the field of healthcare, security poses additional challenges due to the secure transfer, arrival and access, availability of medical device. Ultimately human well-being is the superior necessity. It has become more vulnerable due to its features like mobility, heterogeneity, decentralized and additional challenges sensitive health information records, interoperability of medical IoT device. Therefore, Fog computing demands exclusive way for security and privacy measurements rather than existing measures for cloud computing. Also, as the number of access point increases it is open for more vulnerability. Implanted devices are more critical as if it is not properly secured, then they may put patient in a critical situation. This chapter discusses about basic security and privacy issues which state the need for security in Fog-based medical devices. Different possible attacks and threats are covered with the scenario of implanted medical device. Security challenges for different segments of Fog computing like device, network, and data have been discussed with in-depth analysis for security challenges, privacy, and trust issues in the relation of healthcare 4.0. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Identification of a Malicious Optical Edge Device in the SDN-Based Optical Fog/Cloud Computing Network	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049731366&doi=10.1515%2fjoc-2018-0047&partnerID=40&md5=9c3038e52afabd7e035f04e68a871e21	Software-defined networking (SDN) and optical transmission are the most cost-effective technologies for implementing high-bandwidth-based communication in the fog/cloud computing environment. The passive optical network uses optical line terminals and optical network units as optical edge devices (OEDs) to deliver fog/cloud-based services effectively. The security of such OEDs is one of the key issues for successful implementation of fog/cloud computing over the SDN-based optical network. The main security challenge is to detect and prevent the malicious OED that transmitting abusing data-frames in the SDN-based optical fog/cloud computing network. An OED can be easily hacked by the attacker to launch intrusive attacks those affect the quality of service of the optical channel. In this paper, a secure framework is proposed for identifying malicious OED in the fog/cloud computing over the SDN-based optical network. It identifies the malicious OED and shifts it to the honeypot to mitigate and analyze the attack. It uses two-stage hidden Markov model (HMM), intrusion detection system (IDS)-based fog manager and an optical virtual honeypot device (OVHD). A two-stage HMM is effectively used to reduce the false alarms of IDS in the identification of malicious OED and shifting it onto the OVHD. The OVHD is created in the SDN-based optical network by using the concept of free-available-resource and optical network virtualization. The proposed OVHD logs all malicious activities as well as attacker's path for preventing future attacks. In order to validate the proposed framework, the simulation of two-stage HMM is implemented in MATLAB and mitigation impacts of the internal attacks are studied by using iFogSim toolkit. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.	fog/cloud computing; Markov model; optical network; optical network virtualization; optical virtual honeypot device.; software-defined networking (SDN)	Cost effectiveness; Fiber optic networks; Fog; Fog computing; Hidden Markov models; Intrusion detection; Light transmission; MATLAB; Optical communication; Passive optical networks; Quality of service; Software defined networking; Virtualization; Computing environments; Cost-effective technology; Honeypots; Intrusion Detection Systems; Markov model; Network virtualization; Optical line terminals; Software defined networking (SDN); Network security
A comparative study of techniques, datasets and performances for intrusion detection systems in IoT	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090258733&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-5329-5_22&partnerID=40&md5=621bec925cbce5f391a13c391713e8ff	IoT Security is the area concerned with safeguarding connected systems. IoT involves the set-up of various integrated devices. Devices are identified with a unique identifier, and provided with the ability to transfer data over the network opens them up to several serious vulnerabilities, if not appropriately protected. An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) plays a crucial part in discovering and preventing numerous attacks entering the network and provide an uncompromised secure system. The sheer volume of the sensors in a system comes with limitations such as interoperability, scalability, and storage, where security algorithms like IDS couldn’t perform well as it requires a huge amount of labelled data for training, to detect intrusions and ascertain new attacks. Fog computing plays a major role with a decentralized architecture allows IoT devices to compute, make decisions, take actions, and push only relevant information to the cloud. Data availability is closer and can act immediately for the sensitive information, which in turn helps the IDS to perform well using Artificial Intelligence algorithm to detect and prevent various attacks.

IoT structures the base of future infrastructures, developing the advancement of future smart cities that are naturally moderate. However, IoT is vulnerable to different cyber-attacks. The most critical issues of the IoT are security and privacy. In this research, the integration of IoT with cloud and fog computing can present an improved platform to support IoT smart city applications. Cloud computing can provide data storage at top-level management and fog computing can offer various services for supporting smart city applications based on IoT. The integrated architecture of the IoT-Fog-Cloud computing model is presented in this research. For the analysis based on Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) anomaly detection, the Improved Naïve Bayes (INB) classifier based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is proposed in this work. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is used for the evaluation of the attack detection model. The PCA technique is used to extract features of the dataset, and the INB classifier is used for the classification of attacks. This technique is proposed to enhance the efficiency of the anomaly detection and to improve the performance analysis in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and detection rate. The INB-PCA achieved 92.48% accuracy and 95.35% detection rate. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Privacy-Preserving Distributed IDS using Incremental Learning for IoT Health Systems	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099575439&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2021.3051530&partnerID=40&md5=a6e4dadf9f3e6c3ad14191b2151c3376	Existing techniques for incremental learning are computationally expensive and produce duplicate features leading to higher false positive and true negative rates. We propose a novel privacy-preserving intrusion detection pipeline for distributed incremental learning. Our pre-processing technique eliminates redundancies and selects unique features by following innovative extraction techniques. We use autoencoders with non-negativity constraints, which help us extract less redundant features. More importantly, the distributed intrusion detection model reduces the burden on the edge classifier and distributes the load among IoT and edge devices. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments have shown lower space and time costs than state of the art techniques, with comparable classification accuracy. Extensive experiments with standard data sets and real-time streaming IoT traffic give encouraging results.

Early DGA-based botnet identification: pushing detection to the edges	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098689743&doi=10.1007%2fs10586-020-03213-z&partnerID=40&md5=2f381a4e9b95935d4d45d71c3a372141	With the first commercially available 5G infrastructures, worldwide’s attention is shifting to the next generation of theorised technologies that might be finally deployable. In this context, the cybersecurity of edge equipment and end-devices must be a top priority as botnets see their spread remarkably increase. Most of them rely on algorithmically generated domain names (AGDs) to evade detection and remain shrouded from intrusion detection systems, via the so-called Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). Despite the issue, by applying concepts such as distributed computing and federated learning, the cybersecurity community has prototyped and developed dynamic and scalable solutions that leverage the increased capabilities and connectivity of edge devices. This article proposes a lightweight and privacy-preserving framework that pushes the intelligence modules to the edges aiming to achieve early DGA-based botnet detection in mobile and edge-oriented scenarios. Experimental results prove the deployability of such architecture at all levels, including resource-constrained end-devices. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	5G; Cybersecurity; Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA); Edge artificial intelligence; Federated learning; Machine learning	Botnet; Intrusion detection; Privacy by design; Botnet detections; Cyber security; Deployability; Domain names; Generation algorithm; Intrusion Detection Systems; Privacy preserving; Scalable solution; 5G mobile communication systems

Artificial intelligence (AI) provides solutions in huge technological issues in various aspects of day-to-day life such as autonomous transportation, governance, healthcare, agriculture, maintenance, logistics, and education that are automated, managed, controlled, and accessed remotely with the aid of smart devices. Cognitive computing is denoted as a next-generation AI-dependent method that gives human-computer interactions with personalized services that replicate manual behavior. Simultaneously, massive data is generated from the applications of the smart city like smart transportation, retail industry, healthcare, and governance.

Design and implementation of virtual security function based on multiple enclaves	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099786245&doi=10.3390%2ffi13010012&partnerID=40&md5=5c4d1c68d10e44462016e21b2edbde4b	Network function virtualization (NFV) provides flexible and scalable network function for the emerging platform, such as the cloud computing, edge computing, and IoT platforms, while it faces more security challenges, such as tampering with network policies and leaking sensitive processing states, due to running in a shared open environment and lacking the protection of proprietary hardware. Currently, Intel® Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides a promising way to build a secure and trusted VNF (virtual network function) by isolating VNF or sensitive data into an enclave. However, directly placing multiple VNFs in a single enclave will lose the scalability advantage of NFV. This paper combines SGX and click technology to design the virtual security function architecture based on multiple enclaves. In our design, the sensitive modules of a VNF are put into different enclaves and communicate by local attestation. The system can freely combine these modules according to user requirements, and increase the scalability of the system while protecting its running state security. In addition, we design a new hot-swapping scheme to enable the system to dynamically modify the configuration function at runtime, so that the original VNFs do not need to stop when the function of VNFs is modified. We implement an IDS (intrusion detection system) based on our architecture to verify the feasibility of our system and evaluate its performance. The results show that the overhead introduced by the system architecture is within an acceptable range. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The novelty of attacks with each passing day poses a conundrum to the organizations and sectors deploying the IoT. The fact remains that conventional cybersecurity frameworks face the trouble of distinguishing unknown attacks in most scenarios. Recent studies explore the endless capabilities of machine learning (ML) in reinstating the security of the IoT infrastructure. ML includes the capability of self-study and training for discovering the path for security breach and attack detection. The training methodology and progression in ML is superior to centralized detection systems. A novel methodology of distributed training on fog node in the IoT architecture with exchange of parameters (DT-FN) enhancement of intelligence through machine learning is proposed in this paper. The analyses have demonstrated that appropriated assault recognition framework has outsmarted the incorporated discovery frameworks utilizing ML model. Intrusion detection system of IoT has been incorporated on DL for more effectiveness and identification of higher level security threats. Target prejudgement-based interruption identification framework for IoT has also been discussed. The key metrics that are considered are detection rate, detection accuracy, false alarm rate, F1 measurement, precision and recall. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

PHYAlert: identity spoofing attack detection and prevention for a wireless edge network	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078406084&doi=10.1186%2fs13677-020-0154-7&partnerID=40&md5=7bfed2cb2ccd081902e5eb7195107fe8	Delivering service intelligence to billions of connected devices is the next step in edge computing. Wi-Fi, as the de facto standard for high-throughput wireless connectivity, is highly vulnerable to packet-injection-based identity spoofing attacks (PI-ISAs). An attacker can spoof as the legitimate edge coordinator and perform denial of service (DoS) or even man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks with merely a laptop. Such vulnerability leads to serious systematic risks, especially for the core edge/cloud backbone network.In this paper, we propose PHYAlert, an identity spoofing attack alert system designed to protect a Wi-Fi-based edge network. PHYAlert profiles the wireless link with the rich dimensional Wi-Fi PHY layer information and enables real-time authentication for Wi-Fi frames. We prototype PHYAlert with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices and perform extensive experiments in different scenarios. The experiments verify the feasibility of spoofing detection based on PHY layer information and show that PHYAlert can achieve an 8x improvement in the false positive rate over the conventional signal-strength-based solution. © 2020, The Author(s).

Semisupervised-Learning-Based Security to Detect and Mitigate Intrusions in IoT Network	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094119775&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.2993410&partnerID=40&md5=73c5b341d2fd4f5f17fba32a4294a7a2	Our world is moving toward an Internet of Things (IoT) era by connecting billions of IoT. There are several security loopholes in the IoT network. Intrusion can lead to performance degradation and pose a threat to data security. Hence, there is a need for a method to detect intrusion in the IoT networks. Existing solutions use supervised-learning-based intrusion detection methods that need a huge labeled data set for better accuracy. It is not easy to source out a huge labeled data set because the size of the IoT network is huge. To overcome some of the impediments in the existing solutions, we propose a novel SDRK machine learning (ML) algorithm to detect intrusion. SDRK leverages supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) and unsupervised clustering techniques. The intrusion detection and mitigation algorithms are placed in the fog nodes that are between IoT and cloud layers. We test our proposed methodology against the data deluge (DD) attack in the testbed. The SDRK model is tested on the benchmark NSL-KDD data set. We compare the results with state-of-the-art solutions. When testing with the NSL-KDD data set, we find that SDRK detects the attacks with improved accuracy of 99.78%. © 2014 IEEE.

Trustworthy and sustainable smart city services at the edge	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088914322&doi=10.1016%2fj.scs.2020.102394&partnerID=40&md5=fa49f52129c199af1bec920470e95341	The proliferation of smart city and Internet of Things (IoT) applications has introduced numerous challenges related to network performance, reliability, and security. Moreover, the distributed nature of the smart city and IoT infrastructure hs led to issues in regards to service availability, reliability, sustainability and security. Edge computing provides a decentralized computing and communication framework for different types of applications such as intelligent transportation systems, cognitive assistance, health and social services. Edge computing helps in improving the performance of such applications and reduces the end-to-end latency incurred for such time-critical applications. In this article, we introduce a trustworthy smart city service delivery solution at the edge of the network. The solution uses a collaborative technique between distributed edge servers and privacy mediator nodes with the support of an intrusion detection system to enhance the availability, reliability and security of smart city applications. Simulation results show a reduction in the delay per service request by 39.2% for highly dense environments, and up to 62.6% for lightly dense environments. Moreover, the solution reduces the dropped service requests below 2% with high accuracy and detection rates and low false-negative rates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	Availability; Edge computing; Internet of things; Reliability; Security; Smart city; Sustainability	Cognitive systems; Edge computing; Intelligent systems; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Quality of service; Reliability; Smart city; Cognitive assistance; Collaborative technique; Communication framework; End to end latencies; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Time-critical applications; Network security
Hybrid approach to intrusion detection in fog-based IoT environments	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087884251&doi=10.1016%2fj.comnet.2020.107417&partnerID=40&md5=e18aefa408036a2fa03a9424735e14c3	In the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, information of various kinds is continuously captured, processed, and transmitted by systems generally interconnected by the Internet and distributed solutions. Attacks to capture information and overload services are common. This fact makes security techniques indispensable in IoT environments. Intrusion detection is one of the vital security points, aimed at identifying attempted attacks. The characteristics of IoT devices make it impossible to apply these solutions in this environment. Also, the existing anomaly-based methods for multiclass detection do not present acceptable accuracy. We present an intrusion detection architecture that operates in the fog computing layer. It has two steps and aims to classify events into specific types of attacks or non-attacks, for the execution of countermeasures. Our work presents a relevant contribution to the state of the art in this aspect. We propose a hybrid binary classification method called DNN-kNN. It has high accuracy and recall rates and is ideal for composing the first level of the two-stage detection method of the presented architecture. The approach is based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm. It was evaluated with the public databases NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017. We used the method of selecting attributes based on the rate of information gain. The approach proposed in this work obtained 99.77% accuracy for the NSL-KDD dataset and 99.85% accuracy for the CICIDS2017 dataset. The experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid approach was able to achieve greater precision about classic machine learning approaches and the recent advances in intrusion detection for IoT systems. In addition, the approach works with low overhead in terms of memory and processing costs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A security protection system is designed to promote the security and privacy of big data in edge computing called video sensor security system. In the system, an intrusion detection model based on deep neural network is proposed and implemented to monitor the traffic as a passive defense of the sensing layer on edge computing platform EdgeX Foundry. Camera pattern noise is used as a credential for authentication as the active defense of the sensing layer. The camera will not access the edge network until passing intrusion detection model verification and authentication which ensures that unauthorized users will not be accessed to EdgeX Foundry. In the double security protection, this security protection system has been proved to have good performance and high security. © 2020 IEEE.	deep neural network; edge computing; intrusion detection system; pattern noise; video IoT	Authentication; Big data; Cameras; Deep neural networks; Edge computing; Foundries; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Multilayer neural networks; Privacy by design; Security systems; Sensor networks; Signal processing; Computing platform; Intrusion detection models; Security and privacy; Security protection; Security protection systems; Unauthorized users; Urgent problems; Video-sensor networks; Network security
Anomaly Detection in Distribution Power System based on a Condition Monitoring Vector and Ultra- Short Demand Forecasting	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096905290&doi=10.1109%2fCyberPELS49534.2020.9311534&partnerID=40&md5=155a6e2897857053fed4a04f1eafde90	This paper presents a proactive intrusion detection system (IDS) for smart distribution power systems. The considered attack scenario is manipulation of the advanced measuring infrastructures (AMIs) readings and/or smart inverters data. These manipulated data from the grid edge devices mislead the grid operator for making proper operational planning decisions. In a stealthy attack model, where the attacker compromises significant number of these smart devices, serious demand-supply unbalance can occur that may result in major blackouts. The proposed IDS is based on a condition monitoring vector (CMV) equipped with a learned ultra-short-term demand forecasting (USTDF) mechanism. This cybersecurity approach is able to verify smart devices readings. In the proposed method, the instantaneous difference of collected AMIs and other smart devices data with the ultra-short term forecasted demand is defined as the CMV. This vector probes a pre-defined error band for identifying the compromised smart devices. The learned USTDF mechanism is based on the distribution grid historical load profile and the temperature data for the goal area. An accurate multi-dimensional regression model is developed and learned for forecasting the load behavior in this area. Finally, the suspicious areas are flagged or become separated from the main grid by the network operator based on the proposed CMV outcomes and the output of decision-making module. The proposed IDS aims to enhance the cybersecurity of the smart devices at the grid-edge that plays major role in ensuring the resiliency of the grid. The theoretical analyses are verified by several case studies. © 2020 IEEE.

5G In the internet of things era: An overview on security and privacy challenges	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086385493&doi=10.1016%2fj.comnet.2020.107345&partnerID=40&md5=832fee01195ba148506195d64c1eb2f5	Now reaching 2020, the world is witnessing the initial diffusion of 5G networks, which promise to revolutionize the mobile wireless communications, providing faster services, very low delays, and a very pervasive connectivity via mobile devices. It is worth to remark that the main paradigm which will take advantage from 5G is really the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the spreading of 5G technology also generates important concerns in terms of security and privacy, due to the continuous and wireless connection to the network, which hinders the reliability of the involved devices. This paper deeply analyzed the current state of the art about the existing security and privacy solutions tailored to 5G. More in detail, the following requirements are discussed: data integrity, confidentiality, authentication, access control, non-repudiation, trust, privacy, identity management, key management, policy enforcement, and intrusion detection. Furthermore, the paper aims to shed the light on future research directions towards the realization of secure and privacy aware 5G systems. To this end, the role of emerging paradigms, such as IoT, fog computing, and blockchain is investigated. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	5G; Blockchain; Fog computing; Internet of things; Privacy; Security	Access control; Fog computing; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Network security; Future research directions; Identity management; Internet of thing (IOT); Mobile wireless communications; Pervasive connectivity; Policy enforcement; Security and privacy; Wireless connection; 5G mobile communication systems
An anomaly mitigation framework for iot using fog computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091643039&doi=10.3390%2felectronics9101565&partnerID=40&md5=f341fcd436c906761deb00e660cbd271	The advancement in IoT has prompted its application in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, etc., and this has aided its exponential growth. However, alongside this development, IoT networks are experiencing a rise in security challenges such as botnet attacks, which often appear as network anomalies. Similarly, providing security solutions has been challenging due to the low resources that characterize the devices in IoT networks. To overcome these challenges, the fog computing paradigm has provided an enabling environment that offers additional resources for deploying security solutions such as anomaly mitigation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly mitigation framework for IoT using fog computing to ensure faster and accurate anomaly detection. The framework employs signature-and anomaly-based detection methodologies for its two modules, respectively. The signature-based module utilizes a database of attack sources (blacklisted IP addresses) to ensure faster detection when attacks are executed from the blacklisted IP address, while the anomaly-based module uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm for accurate classification of network traffic flow into normal or abnormal. We evaluated the performance of both modules using an IoT-based dataset in terms response time for the signature-based module and accuracy in binary and multiclass classification for the anomaly-based module. The results show that the signature-based module achieves a fast attack detection of at least six times faster than the anomaly-based module in each number of instances evaluated. The anomaly-based module using the XGBoost classifier detects attacks with an accuracy of 99% and at least 97% for average recall, average precision, and average F1 score for binary and multiclass classification. Additionally, it recorded 0.05 in terms of false-positive rates. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Passban IDS: An Intelligent Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System for IoT Edge Devices	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085562685&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.2970501&partnerID=40&md5=17860efa5d687d9b0a6b107098faaf5a	Cyber-threat protection is today's one of the most challenging research branches of information technology, while the exponentially increasing number of tiny, connected devices able to push personal data to the Internet is doing nothing but exacerbating the battle between the involved parties. Thus, this protection becomes crucial with a typical Internet-of-Things (IoT) setup, as it usually involves several IoT-based data sources interacting with the physical world within various application domains, such as agriculture, health care, home automation, critical industrial processes, etc. Unfortunately, contemporary IoT devices often offer very limited security features, laying themselves open to always new and more sophisticated attacks and also inhibiting the expected global adoption of IoT technologies, not to mention millions of IoT devices already deployed without any hardware security support. In this context, it is crucial to develop tools able to detect such cyber threats. In this article, we present Passban, an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) able to protect the IoT devices that are directly connected to it. The peculiarity of the proposed solution is that it can be deployed directly on very cheap IoT gateways (e.g., single-board PCs currently costing few tens of U.S. dollars), hence taking full advantage of the edge computing paradigm to detect cyber threats as close as possible to the corresponding data sources. We will demonstrate that Passban is able to detect various types of malicious traffic, including Port Scanning, HTTP and SSH Brute Force, and SYN Flood attacks with very low false positive rates and satisfactory accuracies. © 2014 IEEE.

Dynamic Orchestration of Security Services at Fog Nodes for 5G IoT	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089428259&doi=10.1109%2fICC40277.2020.9149019&partnerID=40&md5=a57859eb4335500fe9aa96007bb1e10d	Fog Computing is one of the edge computing paradigms that envisages being the proximate processing and storage infrastructure for a multitude of IoT appliances. With its dynamic deployability as a medium level cloud service, fog nodes are enabling heterogeneous service provisioning infrastructure that features scalability, interoperability, and adaptability. Out of the various 5G based services possible with the fog computing platforms, security services are imperative but minimally investigated direct live. Thus, in this research, we are focused on launching security services in a fog node with an architecture capable of provisioning on-demand service requests. As the fog nodes are constrained on resources, our intention is to integrate light-weight virtualization technology such as Docker for forming the service provisioning infrastructure. We managed to launch multiple security instances configured to be Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPSs) on the fog infrastructure emulated via a Raspberry Pi-4 device. This environment was tested with multiple network flows to validate its feasibility. In our proposed architecture, orchestration strategies performed by the security orchestrator were stated as guidelines for achieving pragmatic, dynamic orchestration with fog in IoT deployments. The results of this research guarantee the possibility of developing an ambient security service model that facilitates IoT devices with enhanced security. © 2020 IEEE.

Intrusion Detection for Smart Home Security Based on Data Augmentation with Edge Computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089426549&doi=10.1109%2fICC40277.2020.9148632&partnerID=40&md5=9a9ee4f6bc12ccadce2ee3bd04880a66	Smart home is an indispensable part of Internet of Things(IoT) owing to the prompt development and application of smart devices. However, the data collected from smart homes usually need to be processed by a cloud server, which means there is a risk of leaking the privacy of users during the transmission. In this situation, edge computing is considered to be an ideal platform for smart home, which enable data to be processed at edge nodes. Unfortunately, because of unsecured Wi-Fi connection and smart devices, edge nodes also have the possibility to encounter malicious attacks. Hence, in this paper, we designed an intrusion detection system (IDS) to be deployed on edge nodes. We convert network traffic to images which are applied to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the categories of network traffic. Furthermore, Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) is adopted to generate synthesized samples to expand the intrusion detection dataset. We experiment on the UNSW-NB15 dataset which contains substantial network traffic about the normal and anomalies. The proposed scheme is effective to minor categories of which precision could be improved 12%. Besides, the precision can reach 96% in binary classification about normal and anomaly. © 2020 IEEE.

Evaluation of Centralised vs Distributed Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems in Multi-Access Edge Computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090034323&partnerID=40&md5=f06b1a5d5051793ae72d61fe3d5db044	With the rapid adoption of next generation networking architectures in 5G, like Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), there is a shift in the core processing capabilities to the edge of the network. This helps facilitate higher bandwidth and ultra-low latency responses, but can increase the attack surface for cyber-attacks like Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). To safeguard these architectures without degrading performance, we require mechanisms capable of detecting these attacks in near-real time. Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS) are a popular choice for detecting sophisticated coordinated attacks in large complex networks, and a prime candidate for use in this context. However, finding the right CIDS deployment model is not straightforward, with each model presenting its own set of challenges like accuracy as well as network and computational overhead. In this paper, we focus on evaluating two CIDS models - a centralised vs a distributed approach using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs), based on their detection accuracy, CPU and memory usage, and data transmission overhead. We assess each approach through experimentation with a real-world worm dataset to understand the complexities involved in developing an efficient intrusion detection solution for MEC. © 2020 IFIP.	5G; Cybersecurity; DHT; Intrusion Detection; Multi-Access Edge Computing	5G mobile communication systems; Complex networks; Coordination reactions; Denial-of-service attack; Edge computing; Network architecture; Network security; Next generation networks; Collaborative intrusion detection system; Computational overheads; Coordinated attack; Detection accuracy; Distributed approaches; Distributed denial of service; Distributed hash tables; Next generation networking; Intrusion detection
Security as a Service Platform Leveraging Multi-Access Edge Computing Infrastructure Provisions	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089414295&doi=10.1109%2fICC40277.2020.9148660&partnerID=40&md5=abc1b4f9136f9a4275ccbf721a0a8ae5	The mobile service platform envisaged by emerging IoT and 5G is guaranteeing gigabit-level bandwidth, ultra-low latency and ultra-high storage capacity for their subscribers. In spite of the variety of applications plausible with the envisaged technologies, security is a demanding objective that should be applied beyond the design stages. Thus, Security as a Service (SECaaS) is an initiative for a service model that enable mobile and IoT consumers with diverse security functions such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDPaaS), Authentication (AaaS), and Secure Transmission Channel (STCaaS) as a Service. A well-equipped edge computing infrastructure is intrinsic to achieve this goal. The emerging Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm standardized by the ETSI is excelling among other edge computing flavours due to its well-defined structure and protocols. Thus, in our directive, we intend to utilize MEC as the edge computing platform to launch the SECaaS functions. Though, the actual development of a MEC infrastructure is highly dependent on the integration of virtualization technologies to enable dynamic creation, the deployment, and the detachment of virtualized entities that should feature interoperability to cater the heterogeneous IoT devices and services. To that extent, this work is proposing a security service architecture that offers these SECaaS services. Further, we validate our proposed architecture through the development of a virtualized infrastructure that integrates lightweight and hypervisor-based virtualization technologies. Our experiments prove the plausibility of launching multiple security instances on the developed prototype edge platform. © 2020 IEEE.	5G; Docker; Edge Computing; Internet of Things (IoT); Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC); Security; Security as a Service; Virtualization	5G mobile communication systems; Edge computing; Internet of things; Interoperability; Intrusion detection; Platform as a Service (PaaS); Storage as a service (STaaS); Virtualization; Computing infrastructures; Intrusion detection and prevention; Multiple securities; Proposed architectures; Secure transmission; Security as a services; Virtualization technologies; Well-defined structures; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
SparseIDS: Learning Packet Sampling with Reinforcement Learning	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090146953&doi=10.1109%2fCNS48642.2020.9162253&partnerID=40&md5=3aaa06c6e02c0cb4996c8923819aaf9f	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been shown to be valuable for constructing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for network data. They allow determining if a flow is malicious or not already before it is over, making it possible to take action immediately. However, considering the large number of packets that has to be inspected, for example in cloud/fog and edge computing, the question of computational efficiency arises. We show that by using a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach called SparseIDS, we can reduce the number of consumed packets by more than three fourths while keeping classification accuracy high. To minimize the computational expenses of the RL-based sampling we show that a shared neural network can be used for both the classifier and the RL logic. Thus, no additional resources are consumed by the sampling in deployment. Comparing to various other sampling techniques, SparseIDS consistently achieves higher classification accuracy by learning to sample only relevant packets. A major novelty of our RL-based approach is that it can not only skip up to a predefined maximum number of samples like other approaches proposed in the domain of Natural Language Processing but can even skip arbitrarily many packets in one step. This enables saving even more computational resources for long sequences. Inspecting SparseIDS's behavior of choosing packets shows that it adopts different sampling strategies for different attack types and network flows. Finally we build an automatic steering mechanism that can guide SparseIDS in deployment to achieve a desired level of sparsity. © 2020 IEEE.

Federated Mimic Learning for Privacy Preserving Intrusion Detection	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096644034&doi=10.1109%2fBlackSeaCom48709.2020.9234959&partnerID=40&md5=6a010b1bc0e8cd5e02a6a4f2c78bb13e	Internet of things (IoT) devices are prone to attacks due to the limitation of their privacy and security components. These attacks vary from exploiting backdoors to disrupting the communication network of the devices. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play an essential role in ensuring information privacy and security of IoT devices against these attacks. Recently, deep learning-based IDS techniques are becoming more prominent due to their high classification accuracy. However, conventional deep learning techniques jeopardize user privacy due to the transfer of user data to a centralized server. Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving decentralized learning method. FL enables training models locally at the edge devices and transferring local models to a centralized server instead of transferring sensitive data. Nevertheless, FL can suffer from reverse engineering ML attacks that can learn information about the user's data from model. To overcome the problem of reverse engineering, mimic learning is another way to preserve the privacy of ML-based IDS. In mimic learning, a student model is trained with the public dataset, which is labeled with the teacher model that is trained by sensitive user data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of FL and mimic learning, namely federated mimic learning to create a distributed IDS while minimizing the risk of jeopardizing users' privacy, and benchmark its performance compared to other ML-based IDS techniques using NSL-KDD dataset. Our results show that we can achieve 98.11% detection accuracy with federated mimic learning. © 2020 IEEE.

SDN/NFV security framework for fog-to-things computing infrastructure	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074814731&doi=10.1002%2fspe.2761&partnerID=40&md5=be84adf9d90adadfdc85539fd2417a07	Currently, core networking architectures are facing disruptive developments, due to emergence of paradigms such as Software-Defined-Networking (SDN) for control, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for services, and so on. These are the key enabling technologies for future applications in 5G and locality-based Internet of things (IoT)/wireless sensor network services. The proliferation of IoT devices at the Edge networks is driving the growth of all-connected world of Internet traffic. In the Cloud-to-Things continuum, processing of information and data at the Edge mandates development of security best practices to arise within a fog computing environment. Service providers are transforming their business using NFV-based services and SDN-enabled networks. The SDN paradigm offers an easily programmable model, global view, and control for modern networks, which demand faster response to security incidents and dynamically enforce countermeasures to intrusions and cyberattacks. This article proposes an autonomic multilayer security framework called Distributed Threat Analytics and Response System (DTARS) for a converged architecture of Fog/Edge computing and SDN infrastructures, for emerging applications in IoT and 5G networks. The major detection scheme is deployed within the data plane, consisting of a coarse-grained behavioral, anti-spoofing, flow monitoring and fine-grained traffic multi-feature entropy-based algorithms. We developed exemplary defense applications under DTARS framework, on a malware testbed imitating the real-life DDoS/botnets such as Mirai. The experiments and analysis show that DTARS is capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 95% under attack intensities up to 50 000 packets/s. The benign traffic forwarding rate remains unaffected with DTARS, while it drops down to 65% with traditional NIDS for advanced DDoS attacks. Further, DTARS achieves this performance without incurring additional latency due to data plane overhead. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	5G; Cloud security; Edge network; Fog computing; Internet of things (IoT); Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS); NFV; OpenFlow; SDN	5G mobile communication systems; Computer architecture; Denial-of-service attack; Fog; Fog computing; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Malware; Network function virtualization; Sensor networks; Cloud securities; EDGE Networks; Internet of Things (IOT); Network intrusion detection systems; Openflow; Network security

As the Internet becomes more deeply integrated into our business operations through IoT platform, the desire for reliable and efficient connections increases as well. Fog and Cloud security is a topical issue associated with every data storage, managing or processing paradigm. Attacks once occurred, have ineradicable and disastrous effects on the development of IoT, Fog, Cloud computing. Therefore, many security systems/models have been proposed and/or implemented for the sake of Fog security. Intrusion detection systems are one of the premier choices especially ones that designed using artificial intelligence. In our paper, we presented an artificially full-automated intrusion detection system for Fog security against cyber-attacks. The proposed model uses multi-layered of recurrent neural networks designed to be implemented for Fog computing security that is very close to the end-users and IoT devices.

In 2020 more than 25% of identified attacks in enterprises will involve the IoT. Hence, it is very important to treat IoT security as a mandatory design factor. Moreover the deployed IoT system should be continuously monitored to detect malicious behaviour such as packet dropping, worm propagation or jammer attacks. In the paper we propose the anomaly based Intrusion Detection System dedicated to Bluetooth Mesh networks. The machine learning algorithm is used to classify traffic and detect malicious behaviour in IoT networks. The proposed solution involve cooperative decision making which is done by multiple watchdogs distributed in different regions of the considered network – which are responsible for processing of mostly local traffic. The optimal placement of watchdogs is proposed based on simulations done by BMWatchSim software. The experimental results coming from our testbed confirm that the watchdog placement proposed by simulator allow on effective detection of real-world intrusions. © 2019 The Authors	Bluetooth Mesh; Cooperation; Fog computing; Internet of Things; Intrusion Detection System; Placement; Security; Simulation; Watchdog	Bluetooth; Computer crime; Decision making; Fog computing; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Network security; Cooperation; Intrusion Detection Systems; Placement; Security; Simulation; Watchdog; Anomaly detection

Recently, security breaches in many IoT applications have indicated that IoT applications may put the physical systems at risk. Severe resource constraints and insufficient security design are two major causes of many security problems in IoT applications. As an extension of the cloud, the emerging edge computing with rich resources provides us a new venue to design and deploy novel security solutions for IoT applications. Although there are some research efforts in this area, edge-based security designs for IoT applications are still in its infancy. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of existing IoT security solutions at the edge layer as well as to inspire more edge-based IoT security designs. We first present an edge-centric IoT architecture. Then, we extensively review the edge-based IoT security research efforts in the context of security architecture designs, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, authentication and authorization protocols, and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Finally, we propose our insight into future research directions and open research issues. © 2019 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications	Architecture; Authentication; Authorization; Edge computing; Firewall; Internet of Things (IoT); Intrusion detection; Privacy; Secure protocols; Security	
Virtual Machine Introspection for Anomaly-Based Keylogger Detection	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085696915&doi=10.1109%2fHPSR48589.2020.9098980&partnerID=40&md5=f32f19d0cf2da2780acb682b94f2636c	Software Keyloggers are dominant class of malicious applications that surreptitiously logs all the user activity to gather confidential information. Among many other types of keyloggers, API-based keyloggers can pretend as unprivileged program running in a user-space to eavesdrop and record all the keystrokes typed by the user. In a Linux environment, defending against these types of malware means defending the kernel against being compromised and it is still an open and difficult problem. Considering how recent trend of edge computing extends cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) to the edge of the network, a new types of intrusion-detection system (IDS) has been used to mitigate cybersecurity threats in edge computing. Proposed work aims to provide secure environment by constantly checking virtual machines for the presence of keyloggers using cutting edge artificial immune system (AIS) based technology. The algorithms that exist in the field of AIS exploit the immune system's characteristics of learning and memory to solve diverse problems. We further present our approach by employing an architecture where host OS and a virtual machine (VM) layer actively collaborate to guarantee kernel integrity. This collaborative approach allows us to introspect VM by tracking events (interrupts, system calls, memory writes, network activities, etc.) and to detect anomalies by employing negative selection algorithm (NSA). © 2020 IEEE.

In the public domain, how to provide a safe environment and convenient services is a topic of great concern to the government, police units and the public. In the past, in the management of intrusion detection on the periphery of the plant area, approaches with constructing infrared sensing and embedding wire to sense the passage of objects have been adopted. Apart from the problem of high construction cost, the hardly distinguishing people, animals or objects often happens. In this study, through image analysis with edge-computing way, the VPU (Video Processing Unit) in NVR (Networks Digital Video Recorder) combined with a machine learning approach is designed to set a virtual no-entry area in the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) station. When someone enters the no-entry area, the image of person is marked and counted. The results show that the accuracy rate is 90.81% in terms of personnel entering the no-entry area. The main errors occur in personnel duplication marks and multiple duplication marks. In terms of personnel classification, the accuracy rate is 91.32%, and the main errors occur in similar wearing personnel. © 2020 IEEE.	edge-computing; electronic fences system; machine vision; MRT; no-entry area detection; VPU	Biomedical engineering; Computer graphics; Edge computing; Health care; Intrusion detection; Multimedia systems; Personnel; Sustainable development; Turing machines; Video recording; Video signal processing; Videocassette recorders; Accuracy rate; Construction costs; Digital video recorders; Infrared sensing; Machine learning approaches; Mass rapid transit; Public domains; Video processing unit; Rapid transit

Hence, intrusion detection accuracy as well as efficiency is sensitive to the normal operation of VANETs. Regarding this, in this article we propose an architecture of IDPS for VANETs. One of the highlights of the architecture is that it applies RL throughout the architecture in order to deal with the dynamics of VANETs and to make proper decisions according to current VANETs states, aiming at high detection accuracy. On the other hand, the architecture is deployed in EC in an attempt to obtain low detection latency with high processing efficiency, since VANETs IDPS is sensitive to latency, especially for safety applications. A case study is conducted to assess the validity of the proposed VANETs IDPS in EC, with the results revealing that it holds the capacity to detect and prevent intrusion in VANETs in complex environments. © 1986-2012 IEEE.

Towards Accelerating Intrusion Detection Operations at the Edge Network using FPGAs	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094633754&doi=10.1109%2fFMEC49853.2020.9144926&partnerID=40&md5=d6d2bc4b88c1ae2c49b8429677b330a8	In the current paper, we present our work towards accelerating intrusion detection operations at the edge network using FPGAs. Cloud computing and network function virtualization have led to a new appealing paradigm for service delivery and management. Unfortunately, this paradigm fails to correctly support IoT applications and services that seek better communication platforms. Security as a Service can also be seen as a cloud-based model that needs to be accommodated to fulfill these services requirements. Again, one of the main issues to be addressed in this context is how to improve the performance of such systems or services in order to make them capable of coping with the huge amount of data while remaining reliable. A potential solution is the FPGA based edge computing, which is a powerful combination offering FPGA acceleration capabilities together with edge and fog benefits. Indeed, our work focusses on devising an Intrusion Prevention architecture called FORTISEC (40SEC), that is meant to operate in a completely softwarized as well as in an FPGA mode. Thereby, we present suitable algorithms, design principles and well defined components towards the implementation of accelerated intrusion prevention on the edge. We also present a testbed being utilized for the implementation of 40SEC and its performance testing. © 2020 IEEE.

Intrusion detection in Edge-of-Things computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077079190&doi=10.1016%2fj.jpdc.2019.12.008&partnerID=40&md5=06d5bd3729024db0f4675eb20f806579	Edge-of-Things (EoT) is a new evolving computing model driven by the Internet of Things (IoT). It enables data processing, storage, and service to be shifted from the Cloud to nearby Edge devices/systems such as smartphones, routers, and base stations on the IoT paradigm. However, this architectural shift causes the security and privacy issues to migrate to the different layers of the Edge architecture. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such a distributed environment is difficult. In this scenario, an Intrusion Detection Systems is necessary. Here, we propose an approach to quickly and accurately detect intrusive activities in the EoT network, to realize the full potential of the IoT. Specifically, we propose a deep belief network (DBN) based on an advanced intrusion detection approach. We studied different detection models, by using different structures of DBNs, and compared them with existing detection techniques. Test results show that the proposed methodology performs essentially superior to the current state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Designing efficient sinkhole attack detection mechanism in edge-based IoT deployment	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080127352&doi=10.3390%2fs20051300&partnerID=40&md5=9846165e89b4d7abaed7bbc74adeb41a	The sinkhole attack in an edge-based Internet of Things (IoT) environment (EIoT) can devastate and ruin the whole functioning of the communication. The sinkhole attacker nodes (SHAs) have some properties (for example, they first attract the other normal nodes for the shortest path to the destination and when normal nodes initiate the process of sending their packets through that path (i.e., via SHA), the attacker nodes start disrupting the traffic flow of the network). In the presence of SHAs, the destination (for example, sink node i.e., gateway/base station) does not receive the required information or it may receive partial or modified information. This results in reduction of the network performance and degradation in efficiency and reliability of the communication. In the presence of such an attack, the throughput decreases, end-to-end delay increases and packet delivery ratio decreases. Moreover, it may harm other network performance parameters. Hence, it becomes extremely essential to provide an effective and competent scheme to mitigate this attack in EIoT. In this paper, an intrusion detection scheme to protect EIoT environment against sinkhole attack is proposed, which is named as SAD-EIoT. In SAD-EIoT, the resource rich edge nodes (edge servers) perform the detection of different types of sinkhole attacker nodes with the help of exchanging messages. The practical demonstration of SAD-EIoT is also provided using the well known NS2 simulator to compute the various performance parameters. Additionally, the security analysis of SAD-EIoT is conducted to prove its resiliency against various types of SHAs. SAD-EIoT achieves around 95.83% detection rate and 1.03% false positive rate, which are considerably better than other related existing schemes. Apart from those, SAD-EIoT is proficient with respect to computation and communication costs. Eventually, SAD-EIoT will be a suitable match for those applications which can be used in critical and sensitive operations (for example, surveillance, security and monitoring systems). © 2020 by the authors.

First, on the basis of defining the optimal feature evaluation index, the parallel discrete optimization feature extraction framework is constructed to effectively reduce the data dimensionality and improve the robustness of the feature extraction process. Second, a new discrete optimization algorithm (DOA) is designed, and the DOA implementation process is given according to the characteristics of engineering optimization problem. As DOA is proved to converge to the global optimal solution, the best feature combination is extracted. Finally, sensor cloud intrusion detection is carried out by using the best feature subset and the distributed fuzzy clustering technology. The intelligent iterative evolution method and adaptive clustering strategy are introduced to improve the performance of fuzzy clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively give intrusion detection results. Compared with other detection algorithms, the anomaly detection accuracy and missed detection rate of the proposed algorithm are significantly improved, and it has strong anti-noise ability. © 2020, Jilin University Press.

In such a scenario, the attacker introduces many attacks to the edge before forwarding them to distributed servers. This necessitates intrusion detection systems for such environments to mitigate security attacks. This paper has projected a basis for characterization of intrusive behaviors in a distributed system based on the functional link neural nets response weighted-average and teaching-learning metaheuristic with elitism on weight-space. The proposed technique makes use of teaching-learning metaheuristic optimization to obtain suitable parameters for the functional link neural net. Furthermore, the processing of duplicate parameters is successfully avoided by using mutation operation. In addition to this, in this paper the proposed method is found to be more efficient in terms of computational burden. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

While providing us considerable convenience, cloud-based computing and storage also bring us many security problems, such as the abuse of information collection and concentrated web servers in the cloud. Traditional intrusion detection systems and web application firewalls are becoming incompatible with the new network environment, and related systems with machine learning or deep learning are emerging. However, cloud-IoT systems increase attacks against web servers, since data centralization carries a more attractive reward. In this article, based on distributed deep learning, we propose a web attack detection system that takes advantage of analyzing URLs. The system is designed to detect web attacks and is deployed on edge devices. The cloud handles the above challenges in the paradigm of the Edge of Things. Multiple concurrent deep models are used to enhance the stability of the system and the convenience in updating. We implemented experiments on the system with two concurrent deep models and compared the system with existing systems by using several datasets. The experimental results with 99.410% in accuracy, 98.91% in true positive rate (TPR), and 99.55% in detection rate of normal requests (DRN) demonstrate the system is competitive in detecting web attacks. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

It leverages sensor technology, cutting edge communication and data analytics technologies and the open Internet to consolidate IT and operational technology (OT) aiming to achieve cost and performance benefits. However, the underlying resource constraints and ad hoc nature of such systems have significant implications especially in achieving effective intrusion detection. Consequently, contemporary solutions requiring a stable infrastructure and extensive computational resources are inadequate to fulfill these characteristics of an IIoT system. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection framework for the energy-constrained IoT devices which form the foundation of an IIoT ecosystem. In view of the ad hoc nature of such systems as well as emerging complex threats such as botnets, we assess the feasibility of collaboration between the host (IoT devices) and the edge devices for effective intrusion detection whilst minimizing energy consumption and communication overhead. We implemented the proposed framework with Contiki operating system and conducted rigorous evaluation to identify potential performance trade-offs. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can minimize energy and communication overheads whilst achieving an effective collaborative intrusion detection for IIoT systems. © 2019	Constrained IoT devices; Industrial IoT; Internet of Things (IoT); Intrusion detection; Performance evaluation	Data Analytics; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Intrusion detection; Network security; Communication overheads; Computational resources; Constrained IoT devices; Contiki operating systems; Industrial IoT; Internet of Things (IOT); Operational technologies; Performance evaluation; Internet of things

The IoT is leading to the development of advanced information services that will require large storage and computational power, as well as real-time processing capabilities. The integration of IoT with emerging technologies such as Fog Computing can complement these requirements with pervasive and cost-effective services capable of processing large-scale geo-distributed information. In any IoT application, communication availability is essential to deliver accurate and useful information, for instance, to take actions during dangerous situations, or to manage critical infrastructures. IoT components like gateways, also called Fog Nodes, face outstanding security challenges as the attack surface grows with the number of connected devices requesting communication services. These Fog nodes can be targeted by an attacker, preventing the nodes from delivering important information to the final users or to perform accurate automated actions. This paper introduces an Anomaly Behavior Analysis Methodology based on Artificial Neural Networks, to implement an adaptive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of detecting when a Fog node has been compromised, and then take the required actions to ensure communication availability. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach has the capability for characterizing the normal behavior of Fog Nodes despite its complexity due to the adaptive scheme, and also has the capability of detecting anomalies due to any kind of sources such as misuses, cyber-attacks or system glitches, with high detection rate and low false alarms. © 2013 IEEE.

Some new security problems especially the data security and privacy issues have been introduced into the edge computing scenario. Through analyzing the biological immune principles, a novel idea for the problem of intrusion detection in edge computing is provided. Specifically, an edge intrusion detection system (Edge IDS) with a distributed structure, which has the characteristics of an imprecise model, self-learning, and strong interactivity, is constructed in a systematic way inspired by the biological immune principles. Moreover, a newly proposed gene immune detection algorithm (GIDA) is designed. In order that Edge IDS can deal with the dynamic data problem efficiently, the key functional components such as the remaining gene, niching strategy, and extracting vaccine are embedded into the GIDA algorithm. Furthermore, extensive simulation experiments are conducted, and the results show that the proposed Edge IDS can be adapted to the domain of edge computing with comparative performance advantages. © 2020 Yajing Zhang et al.

A distributed ensemble design based intrusion detection system using fog computing to protect the internet of things networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096778110&doi=10.1007%2fs12652-020-02696-3&partnerID=40&md5=26328028f501b23b8c43ad3fd93e8eb4	With the development of internet of things (IoT), capabilities of computing, networking infrastructure, storage of data and management have come very close to the edge of networks. This has accelerated the necessity of Fog computing paradigm. Due to availability of Internet, most of our business operations are integrated with IoT platform. Fog computing has enhanced the strategy of collecting and processing, huge amount of data. On the other hand, attacks and malicious activities has adverse consequences on the development of IoT, Fog, and cloud computing. This has led to development of many security models using fog computing to protect IoT network. Therefore, for dynamic and highly scalable IoT environment, a distributed architecture based intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that can distribute the existing centralized computing to local fog nodes and can efficiently detect modern IoT attacks. This paper proposes a novel distributed ensemble design based IDS using Fog computing, which combines k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, and Gaussian naive Bayes as first-level individual learners. At second-level, the prediction results obtained from first level is used by Random Forest for final classification. Most of the existing proposals are tested using KDD99 or NSL-KDD dataset. However, these datasets are obsolete and lack modern IoT-based attacks. In this paper, UNSW-NB15 and actual IoT-based dataset namely, DS2OS are used for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed system. The experimental result revealed that the proposed distributed IDS with UNSW-NB15 can achieve higher detection rate upto 71.18% for Backdoor, 68.98% for Analysis, 92.25% for Reconnaissance and 85.42% for DoS attacks. Similarly, with DS2OS dataset, detection rate is upto 99.99% for most of the attack vectors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Intrusion Detection for Wireless Edge Networks Based on Federated Learning	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097364075&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3041793&partnerID=40&md5=cc20866995f3b4d2c276f3889b6cd8e1	Edge computing provides off-load computing and application services close to end-users, greatly reducing cloud pressure and communication overhead. However, wireless edge networks still face the risk of network attacks. To ensure the security of wireless edge networks, we present Federated Learning-based Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (FedAGRU), an intrusion detection algorithm for wireless edge networks. FedAGRU differs from current centralized learning methods by updating universal learning models rather than directly sharing raw data among edge devices and a central server. We also apply the attention mechanism to increase the weight of important devices, by avoiding the upload of unimportant updates to the server, FedAGRU can greatly reduce communication overhead while ensuring learning convergence.

A Criterion for IDS Deployment on IoT Edge Nodes	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092696430&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-58799-4_40&partnerID=40&md5=ddbe4a4a8d96ab942a5ef900392c5db3	Edge computing becomes a strategic concept of IoT. The edge computing market reaches several billion USD and grows intensively. In edge computing paradigm, the data can be processed close to, or at the edge of the network. This way greatly reduces the computation and communication load of the network core. Moreover, processing data near the sources of data also provides better support for the user privacy. However, an increase in the number of data processing locations will proportionately increase the attack surface. Due to limited capacities and resources, an edge node cannot perform too many complex operations. Especially for the applications with high real-time requirements, efficiency becomes a crucial issue in secure data analytics. Therefore, it is important to get a tradeoff between security and efficiency. We focus on this problem in this paper. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

A home intrusion detection system using recycled edge devices and machine learning algorithm	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091034262&doi=10.14569%2fIJACSA.2020.0110804&partnerID=40&md5=9c44f112ccab6adeb4d30fb9030a2822	This paper proposes a home intrusion detection system that makes the best use of a retired smartphone and an existing Wi-Fi access point. On-board sensors in the smartphone mounted on an entrance door records signals upon unwanted door opening. The access point is reconfigured to serve as a home server and thus it can process sensor data to detect unauthorized access to home by an intruder. Recycling devices enables a home owner to build own security system with no cost as well as helps our society deal with millions of retired devices and waste of computing resources in already-deployed IT devices. In order to improve detection accuracy, this paper proposes a detection method that employs a machine learning algorithm and an analysis technique of time series data. To minimize energy consumption on a battery-powered smartphone, the proposed system utilizes as few sensors as possible and offloads all the computation to the home edge server. We develop a prototype and run experiments to evaluate accuracy performance of the proposed system. Results show that it can detect intrusion with probability of 95% to 100%. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.	Edge computing; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Recycling; Security	
GLIDE: A Game Theory and Data-Driven Mimicking Linkage Intrusion Detection for Edge Computing Networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083483283&doi=10.1155%2f2020%2f7136160&partnerID=40&md5=751a1de4371ad8cac71c2bfbb5094cbc	The real-time and high-continuity requirements of the edge computing network gain more and more attention because of its active defence problem, that is, a data-driven complex problem. Due to the dual constraints of the hybrid feature of edge computing networks and the uncertainty of new attack features, implementing active defence measures such as detection, evasion, trap, and control is essential for the security protection of edge computing networks with high real-time and continuity requirements. The basic idea of safe active defence is to make the defence gain more significant than the attack loss. To encounter the new attacks with uncertain features introduced by the ubiquitous transmission network in the edge computing network, this paper investigates the attack behaviour and presents an attack-defence mechanism based on game theory. Based on the idea of dynamic intrusion detection, we utilize the game theory in the field of edge computing network and suggest a data-driven mimicry intrusion detection game model-based technique called GLIDE. The game income of participants and utility computing methods under different deployment strategies are analysed in detail. According to the proof analysis of the Nash equilibrium condition in the model, the contradictory dynamic game relationship is described. Therefore, the optimal deployment strategy of the multiredundancy edge computing terminal intrusion detection service in the edge computing network is obtained by solving the game balance point. The detection probability of the edge computing network for network attacks is improved, and the cost of intrusion detection of the edge computing network is reduced. © 2020 Qianmu Li et al.

Now-a-days, we see a lot of applications that are making our lives comfortable such as smart cars, smart homes, smart traffic management, smart offices, smart medical consultation, smart cities, etc. All such facilities are in the reach of a common man because of the advancement in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Because of this advancement, new computing and communication environment such as Internet of Things (IoT) came into picture. Lot of research work is in progress in IoT domain which helps for the overall development of the society and makes the lives easy and comfortable. But in the resource constrained environment of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and IoT, it is almost inconceivable to establish a fully secure system. As we are moving forward very fast, technology is becoming more and more vulnerable to the security threats. In future, the number of Internet connected people will be less than the smart objects so we need to prepare a robust system for keeping the above mentioned environments safe and standardized it for the smooth conduction of communication among IoT objects. In this survey paper, we provide the details of threat model applicable for the security of WSN and IoT based communications. We also discuss the security requirements and various attacks possible in WSN and IoT based communication environments. The emerging projects of WSNs integrated to IoT are also briefed. We then provide the details of different architectures of WSN and IoT based communication environments. Next, we discuss the current issues and challenges related to WSN and IoT. We also provide a critical literature survey of recent intrusion detection protocols for IoT and WSN environments along with their comparative analysis.

Packet-based intrusion detection using Bayesian topic models in mobile edge computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092003421&doi=10.1155%2f2020%2f8860418&partnerID=40&md5=5eca2d1afcacb0015d02c9a0a0113984	In this paper, a network intrusion detection system is proposed using Bayesian topic model latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for mobile edge computing (MEC). The method employs tcpdump packets and extracts multiple features from the packet headers. The tcpdump packets are transferred into documents based on the features. A topic model is trained using only attack-free traffic in order to learn the behavior patterns of normal traffic. Then, the test traffic is analyzed against the learned behavior patterns to measure the extent to which the test traffic resembles the normal traffic. A threshold is defined in the training phase as the minimum likelihood of a host. In the test phase, when a host's test traffic has a likelihood lower than the host's threshold, the traffic is labeled as an intrusion. The intrusion detection system is validated using DARPA 1999 dataset. Experiment shows that our method is suitable to protect the security of MEC. © 2020 Xuefei Cao et al.

With the advancement of the Internet over years, the number of attacks over the Internet has been increased. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the supportive layers applicable to information security. IDS provide a salubrious environment for business and keeps away from suspicious network activities. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are applied in IDS in order to identify and classify the security threats. This paper explores the comparative study of various ML algorithms used in IDS for several applications such as fog computing, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, smart city, and 5G network. In addition, this work also aims for classifying the intrusions using ML algorithms like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest. The work was tested with the KDD-CUP dataset and their efficiency was measured and also compared along with the latest researches. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

An Intrusion Detection Scheme Based on Repeated Game in Smart Home	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092143132&doi=10.1155%2f2020%2f8844116&partnerID=40&md5=39555f03c4422ce0e972b6274b4f21e3	Smart Home brings a new people-oriented home life experience. However, the edge devices in this system are facing severe threats such as data security and equipment safety. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an intrusion detection scheme based on repeated game. We first use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify edge devices and equip the intrusion detection system to cluster heads. Secondly, we use the regret minimization algorithm to determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of the one-order game and then take a severe punishment strategy to domesticate malicious attackers. Thirdly, the intrusion detection system can detect malicious attackers by reduction of payoff. Finally, the detailed experimental results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the loss of attacked intrusion detection system and then achieve the purpose of defending against the attacker. © 2020 Rui Zhang et al.

Anomaly Detection for Industrial Control System Based on Autoencoder Neural Network	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089770117&doi=10.1155%2f2020%2f8897926&partnerID=40&md5=1c13e80f1ac8171275454359bf0acbaa	As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) develops rapidly, cloud computing and fog computing become effective measures to solve some problems, e.g., limited computing resources and increased network latency. The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a key factor within the development of IIoT, whose security affects the whole IIoT. ICS involves many aspects, like water supply systems and electric utilities, which are closely related to people's lives. ICS is connected to the Internet and exposed in the cyberspace instead of isolating with the outside recent years. The risk of being attacked increases as a result. In order to protect these assets, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have drawn much attention. As one kind of intrusion detection, anomaly detection provides the ability to detect unknown attacks compared with signature-based techniques, which are another kind of IDS. In this paper, an anomaly detection method with a composite autoencoder model learning the normal pattern is proposed. Unlike the common autoencoder neural network that predicts or reconstructs data separately, our model makes prediction and reconstruction on input data at the same time, which overcomes the shortcoming of using each one alone. With the error obtained by the model, a change ratio is put forward to locate the most suspicious devices that may be under attack. In the last part, we verify the performance of our method by conducting experiments on the SWaT dataset. The results show that the proposed method exhibits improved performance with 88.5% recall and 87.0% F1-score. © 2020 Chao Wang et al.

An Optimal Packet Assignment Algorithm for Multi-level Network Intrusion Detection Systems	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097605201&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-63083-6_23&partnerID=40&md5=123f167c4a2a08a9ec274f61c092ee69	With the outbreaks of recent cyber-attacks, a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) which can detect and classify abnormal traffic data has drawn a lot of attention. Although detection time and accuracy are important factors, there is no work considering both contrastive objectives in an NIDS. In order to quickly and accurately respond to network threats, intrusion detection algorithms should be implemented on both fog and cloud devices, which have different levels of computing capacity and detection time, in a collaborative manner. Therefore, this work proposes a packet assignment algorithm that assigns detection and classification tasks for appropriate processing devices. Specifically, we formulate a novel optimization problem that minimizes detection time while achieving accuracy performance and computational constraints. Then, an optimal packet assignment algorithm that allocates as many packets as possible to fog devices in order to shorten the detection time is proposed. The experimental results on a state-of-the-art network dataset (UNSW-NB15) show that the proposed packet assignment algorithm produces similar performance to the optimal solution with regard to the detection time and accuracy. © 2020, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

Their cybernetic security is a major issue and efficient methods to improve their safety and reliability are required. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are complex systems that discover cybernetic attacks, detect malicious network traffic, and, in general, protect computer systems. Artificial neural networks are used by a variety of advanced intrusion detection systems with outstanding results. Their successful use in the specific conditions of WSNs requires efficient learning, adaptation, and inference.

One of the typical methods to solve these problems is to utilize Fog or Edge Computing, which distributes storage and computing power concentrated in a cloud computing environment through a distributed model. However, in order to compensate for the disadvantages of this distributed network, Mist Computing has emerged as the network model closest to Internet of Things. But, there are thousands of zero-day attacks in the Internet environment of things that communicate by various protocols. Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known attacks. To effectively prevent such attacks, intrusion detection systems in the environment should be more intelligent. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, we propose an artificial intelligence-based intrusion detection system to effectively protect new or continuously changing attacks to IoT in a mist computing environment. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

Quantum authentication is one of the latest extensions of authentication technology in quantum field. So far, most of the quantum identity authentication protocols proposed are based on noise-free environments. However, due to the existence of quantum noise in quantum channels is inevitable, the noise immunity is very important to quantum identity authentication. In this article, a novel quantum identity authentication protocol based on three-photon error avoidance code is proposed. In this protocol, quantum information is encoded on the noiseless subsystem, so the protocol can effectively resist on the interference of noise in the quantum channel to information transmission. The comprehensive analysis of antinoise performance and the security analysis on various eavesdropping attacks shows that the new protocol proposed in this article has not only good antinoise performance but also good security. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

CPSS LR-DDoS Detection and Defense in Edge Computing Utilizing DCNN Q-Learning	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082007437&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.2976706&partnerID=40&md5=287767f7f935743f542cdd230e193602	Existing intrusion detection and defense models for CPSS (Cyber-Physical-Social Systems) are based on analyzing the static intrusion characteristics, which cannot effectively detect large-scale Low-Rate Denial-of-Service (LR-DDoS) attacks, especially in the edge environment. In this paper, we firstly explore and enhance Mirai botnet to a sophisticated multi-targets low-rate TCP attack network, which makes edge LR-DDoS more powerful and obfuscates their activity. And then, we develop a novel intrusion detection and defense hybrid method for above CPSS LR-DDoS scenario in edge environment, which takes advantage of locality sensitive features extraction and Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) to auto learn the optimal features of the original data distribution and employs deep reinforcement learning Q-network as the powerful decision maker to defend attacks. The experimental results in detection phase prove the proposed method can distinguish abnormal network attack flows with higher detection accuracy and faster response time than kinds of Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-means and Surface Learning Neural Network etc. Even more, it has a certain detection rate for unknown new attacks, which means the method is effective and suitable for the actual network environment. The experimental results in defense phase prove it can defense LR-DDoS attacks smoothly. © 2013 IEEE.

IMPACT: Impersonation Attack Detection via Edge Computing Using Deep Autoencoder and Feature Abstraction	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084113760&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.2985089&partnerID=40&md5=bd642ad24395674b064d333afed725eb	An ever-increasing number of computing devices interconnected through wireless networks encapsulated in the cyber-physical-social systems and a significant amount of sensitive network data transmitted among them have raised security and privacy concerns. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is known as an effective defence mechanism and most recently machine learning (ML) methods are used for its development. However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices often have limited computational resources such as limited energy source, computational power and memory, thus, traditional ML-based IDS that require extensive computational resources are not suitable for running on such devices. This study thus is to design and develop a lightweight ML-based IDS tailored for the resource-constrained devices. Specifically, the study proposes a lightweight ML-based IDS model namely IMPACT (IMPersonation Attack deteCTion using deep auto-encoder and feature abstraction). This is based on deep feature learning with gradient-based linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to deploy and run on resource-constrained devices by reducing the number of features through feature extraction and selection using a stacked autoencoder (SAE), mutual information (MI) and C4.8 wrapper. The IMPACT is trained on Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) to detect impersonation attack. Numerical results show that the proposed IMPACT achieved 98.22% accuracy with 97.64% detection rate and 1.20% false alarm rate and outperformed existing state-of-the-art benchmark models. Another key contribution of this study is the investigation of the features in AWID dataset for its usability for further development of IDS. © 2013 IEEE.	edge computing; feature engineering; intrusion detection; IoT security; machine learning; mutual information	Abstracting; Deep learning; Edge computing; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Social computing; Support vector machines; Computational resources; Deep feature learning; Feature extraction and selection; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion Detection Systems; Linear Support Vector Machines; Resourceconstrained devices; Security and privacy; Feature extraction

A Collaborative Security Framework for Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081572041&doi=10.1109%2fTIFS.2020.2973875&partnerID=40&md5=62874fd76f5bccd4ea4df0676deeb741	With the advent of 5G, technologies such as Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have been developed to facilitate simple programmable control of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, WSNs are typically deployed in potentially untrusted environments. Therefore, it is imperative to address the security challenges before they can be implemented. In this paper, we propose a software-defined security framework that combines intrusion prevention in conjunction with a collaborative anomaly detection systems. Initially, an IPS-based authentication process is designed to provide a lightweight intrusion prevention scheme in the data plane. Subsequently, a collaborative anomaly detection system is leveraged with the aim of supplying a cost-effective intrusion detection solution near the data plane. Moreover, to correlate the true positive alerts raised by the sensor nodes in the network edge, a Smart Monitoring System (SMS) is exploited in the control plane. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated under different security scenarios as well as compared with other methods, where the model's high security and reduction of false alarms are demonstrated. © 2019 IEEE.	anomaly detection; collaborative security; fog computing; intrusion detection; Intrusion prevention; software-defined network	5G mobile communication systems; Anomaly detection; Cost effectiveness; Fog computing; Intrusion detection; Network function virtualization; Sensor nodes; Software defined networking; Anomaly detection systems; Collaborative securities; Intrusion prevention; Programmable controls; Security challenges; Security frameworks; Smart monitoring systems; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Network security

Novel Three-Tier Intrusion Detection and Prevention System in Software Defined Network	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087278582&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3002333&partnerID=40&md5=cc59742ed8c46bf6f1201de4750214f0	Software Defined Network (SDN) is a flexible paradigm that provides support for a variety of data-intensive applications with real-world smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This emerging architecture updates with the managing ability and network control. Still, the benefits are challenging to achieve due to the presence of intruder flow into the network. The research topic of intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) has grasped the attention to reduce the effect of intruders. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a targeted attack that develops malicious traffic is flooded into a particular network device. These intruders also involve even with legitimate network devices, the authenticated device will be compromised to inject malicious traffic. In this paper, we investigate the involvement of intruders in three-Tier IDPS with regard to user validation, packet validation and flow validation. Not all the authentication users can be legitimate, since they are compromised, so that the major contribution is to identify all the compromised devices by knee analysis of the packets. Routers are the edge devices employed in first tier which is responsible to validate the IoT user with RFID tag and encrypted signature. Then the authenticated user's packets are submitted into second tier with switches that validates the packets using type-II fuzzy filtering. Then the key features are extracted from packets and they are classified into normal, suspicious and malicious. The mismatched packets are analyzed in controllers which maintain two queues as suspicious and normal. Then suspicious queue packets are classified and predicted using deep learning method.

ProtÉdge: A few-shot ensemble learning approach to software-defined networking-assisted edge security	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092117999&doi=10.1002%2fett.4138&partnerID=40&md5=11cd50a95dcc88c9be419acf2073b5ee	The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has had a significant impact on our lives through many use cases including smart farming, smart homes, and smart healthcare among others. Due to the capacity-constrained nature of many IoT devices, edge computing has become a significant aid for IoT, replacing cloud computing to support the extremely low latency requirements. With the number of smart devices growing exponentially, the large attack surface created by these devices is concerning. Software-defined networking (SDN) based architectures come to the rescue of edge-assisted IoT environments to achieve enhanced security, and they strongly rely on intelligent decision-making capabilities to act upon the high volume of traffic they control. Machine learning-based intelligence is already utilized by these systems with successful results when abundant training data are available; however, most algorithms fail in the lack of sufficient training data. In this article, we propose ProtÉdge, an SDN-based intelligent security architecture for edge-assisted IoT networks, which utilizes a few-shot learning classifier, namely prototypical networks, for highly accurate detection of intrusions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model with the Bot-IoT data set consisting of real-world IoT network flows, as well as an SDN data set modeling an edge-assisted IoT environment and the UNSW-NB15 data set, and show that the proposed model achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art models in the absence of large amounts of sample attacks. The proposed architecture is promising to achieve intelligent security in future's ubiquitous edge-enabled IoT with its low processing overhead and high intrusion detection accuracy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

PIDIoT: Probabilistic intrusion detection for the internet-of-things	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081952638&doi=10.1109%2fGLOBECOM38437.2019.9013264&partnerID=40&md5=cb67310c505e3eb4f8945810d8d9a73e	The Internet-of-things promises sweeping change through increased connectivity and ubiquitous integration of technology into our lives. However, as we create economies of scale for data aggregation and processing, we also create attractive targets for various adversaries. In this work we design a lightweight, probabilistic intrusion detection system, or PIDIoT. We design PIDIoT to use operational measurements from IoT devices, with lightweight hash functions and Bloom filters to perform fuzzy anomaly detection. We experiment with IoT devices operating in an isolated environment, and we show that we can detect over 90% of simulated attacks. While we do not propose PIDIoT as a comprehensive solution for IoT defense, we make a case for its use as part of a layered defense strategy. © 2019 IEEE.

SDNFV Based Threat Monitoring and Security Framework for Multi-Access Edge Computing Infrastructure	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074680513&doi=10.1007%2fs11036-019-01389-2&partnerID=40&md5=54b2c1a90c97686bfbe896de2e4c5c11	DDoS botnet attacks such as Advanced Persistent & Ransom DoS assaults, Botnets and Application DDoS flood attacks are examples of multi-vector, sophisticated application-layer attacks. Conventional IT security approaches are centralized and have limitations in terms of scale, network-wide monitoring and resources for distributed detection. This paper proposes a newer approach that integrates multi-layer cooperative security intelligence on to a converged Software-Defined-Networking/Network-Function-Virtualization architecture in typical Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) scenario. The key features of framework include: a) distributed lightweight real-time DDoS Threat Analytics and Response Framework (DTARS), to identify DDoS/botnets closer to the source of attacks b) behavioral monitoring and profiling functions in data plane and validation of control plane operations, c) advanced correlation, signature, and anomaly detection techniques, d) real-time threat analytics system e) scalable and agile mitigation mechanisms based on a stateful-data plane and security-aware SDN stack. We evaluate the performance of DTARS framework within three practical MEC case studies: SDN enabled Mobile LTE MEC network, SDN enabled IoT MEC network and Software-Defined Datacenter Edge network. In comparison to legacy MEC network, DTARS incurs about 60% less overhead than the Legacy LTE and 40% lesser than a prior OVS SDN based MEC-LTE solution, detection speed that was about 10x faster, detection accuracy of about 96% at different attack intensities and improves the overall end-to-end connection management performance under rapid scaling of end users. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Federated Wireless Network Intrusion Detection	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081394760&doi=10.1109%2fBigData47090.2019.9005507&partnerID=40&md5=9b5a00f2f61e94303a78b52b4caec202	Wi-Fi has become the wireless networking standard that allows short- to medium-range device to connect without wires. For the last 20 year, the Wi-Fi technology has so pervasive that most devices in use today are mobile and connect to the internet through Wi-Fi. Unlike wired network, a wireless network lacks a clear boundary, which leads to significant Wi-Fi network security concerns, especially because the current security measures are prone to several types of intrusion. To address this problem, machine learning and deep learning methods have been successfully developed to identify network attacks. However, collecting data to develop models is expensive and raises privacy concerns. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a federated learning approach that would alleviate such privacy concerns. This initial work on intrusion detection is performed in a simulated environment. Once proven feasible, this process would allow edge devices to collaboratively update global anomaly detection models, without sharing sensitive training data. On a set of tests with the AWID intrusion detection data set, we show that our federated approach is effective in terms of classification accuracy, computation cost, as well as communication cost. © 2019 IEEE.

To address the requirements of securing IoT devices in edge home networks, this paper proposed a strategy capable of securing the network against most malicious activity in real-time. Firstly, we use an edge smart gateway, which is deployed on a Raspberry-Pi, runs an SDN controller and Open vSwtich (OVS) to perform traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and traffic filtering. Then, with limited resources available on edge gateway, we use a lightweight machine-learning algorithm to classify device to device traffic and identify if there is a network intrusion. The classification model extracts features of network traffic, trained by classic supervised learning method-Decision Tree J48, then distinguish between benign and malicious traffic patterns observed in the network. Simulation results show that the model has high accuracy of intrusion and can effectively ensure security of home IoT interactions. © 2019 IEEE.	edge computing; Internet of Things(IoT); machine-learning; network intrusion detection	Anomaly detection; Decision trees; Edge computing; Gateways (computer networks); Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Personal communication systems; Classification models; Intrusion prevention; Lightweight machines; Malicious activities; Network intrusions; Network security solutions; Supervised learning methods; Traffic monitoring; Network security
A Novel Ad-Hoc Mobile Edge Cloud Offering Security Services through Intelligent Resource-Aware Offloading	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071855533&doi=10.1109%2fTNSM.2019.2939221&partnerID=40&md5=2100edb4e2bf1ee68d9877b78cde8026	While the usage of smart devices is increasing, security attacks and malware affecting such terminals are briskly evolving as well. Mobile security suites exist to defend devices against malware and other intrusions. However, they require extensive resources not continuously available on mobile terminals, hence affecting their relevance, efficiency and sustainability. In this paper, we address the aforementioned problem while taking into account the devices limited resources such as energy and CPU usage as well as the mobile connectivity and latency. In this context, we propose an ad-hoc mobile edge cloud that takes advantage of Wi-Fi Direct as means of achieving connectivity, sharing resources, and integrating security services among nearby mobile devices. The proposed scheme embeds a multi-objective resource-aware optimization model and genetic-based solution that provide smart offloading decision based on dynamic profiling of contextual and statistical data from the ad-hoc mobile edge cloud devices. The carried experiments illustrate the relevance and efficiency of exchanging security services while maintaining their sustainability with or without the availability of Internet connection. Moreover, the results provide optimal offloading decision and distribution of security services while significantly reducing energy consumption, execution time, and number of selected computational nodes without sacrificing security. © 2004-2012 IEEE.	ad-hoc mobile edge cloud; cloud computing; edge computing; intrusion detection; mobile computing; resource-aware service offloading; security-as-a-service; Smart offloading; sustainable security services	Cloud computing; Edge computing; Energy utilization; Intrusion detection; Mobile computing; Sustainable development; Edge clouds; Resource aware; Security as a services; Security services; Smart Offloading; Malware
KingFisher: An industrial security framework based on variational autoencoders	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076608684&doi=10.1145%2f3362743.3362961&partnerID=40&md5=16f85c836eb506c45c3227a9d87aef37	The recent evolution of edge computing favored the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) growth, opening dangerous surfaces of vulnerabilities. In this distributed sensor system scenario, due to the insecure interactions between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) networks, cyber-physical threats could lead to destructive consequences for environments and population safety. To deal with industrial cyber-physical security, modern anomaly detection systems implement innovative Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Unfortunately, current solutions still fail to provide an effective prevention to complex industrial threats. In this paper, we present KingFisher, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework based on ML. KingFisher is, to the best of our knowledge, the first solution that looks independently at IT and OT traffic, but also from sensors deployed to capture side-channel physical processes data (e.g., vibrations, background noise). Thanks to this feature, KingFisher can detect attacks that other systems would ignore. As our tests report, the correlation of inferred physical processes status with OT-network and IT-network data can give insights into suspicious and anomalous activities targeting industrial networks. For our framework, we use the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an unsupervised neural network model, to categorize data without a priori knowledge of the dataset.We evaluate the detection capabilities and performances of KingFisher in a proof of concept simulated industrial scenario under cyber-physical attacks. Our preliminary results show that KingFisher identifies attacks on both network and physical layers. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Towards security-as-a-service in multi-access edge	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076258223&doi=10.1145%2f3318216.3363335&partnerID=40&md5=e04d77f50062a666370be3f95263a6e5	The prevailing network security measures are often implemented on proprietary appliances that are deployed at fixed network locations with constant capacity. Such a rigid deployment is sometimes necessary, but undermines the flexibility of security services in meeting the demands of emerging applications, such as augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and 5G for industry 4.0, which are provoked by the evolution of connected and smart devices, their heterogeneity, and integration with cloud and edge computing infrastructures. To loosen these rigid security deployments, in this paper, we propose a data-centric SECurity-as-a-Service (SECaaS) framework for elastic deployment and provisioning of security services at the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure. In particular, we discuss three security services that are suitable for edge deployment: (i) an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), (ii) an access control enforcement system (ACE), and (iii) a communication anonymization service (CA). We benchmark the common security microservices along with the design and implementation of a proof of concept communication anonymization application. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

The IoT will connect not only computers and mobile devices, but also wearable devices, smart buildings, smart cities, electrical grids, and automobiles just to name few. IoT will lead to the development of a wide range of advanced information services that need to be processed in real-time and require large storage and computational power than can be provided by Cloud and Fog Computing. The integration of IoT with Cloud and Fog Computing make IoT capable of processing large-scale geo-distributed information. In any IoT application, communications are critical to deliver the required information to the end user, device or application, for instance to take actions during crisis events. However, IoT communication elements such as gateways or Fog nodes, will introduce major security challenges as they contribute to increase the attack surface, preventing the IoT to deliver accurate information. In this paper, we propose a methodology to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Anomaly Behavior Analysis (ABA) to detect when a Fog node has been compromised. The preliminary experimental results show that our proposed approach accurately detects known and unknown anomalies due to misuses or cyber-attacks, with high detection rate and low false alarms. © 2019 IEEE.

Machine Learning for Security at the IoT Edge-A Feasibility Study	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084111495&doi=10.1109%2fMASSW.2019.00009&partnerID=40&md5=b625569775d4ae8ea6ed7dc190dc0451	Benefits of edge computing include reduced latency and bandwidth savings, privacy-by-default and by-design in compliance with new privacy regulations that encourage sharing only the minimal amount of data. This creates a need for processing data locally rather than sending everything to a cloud environment and performing machine learning there. However, most IoT edge devices are resource-constrained in comparison and it is not evident whether current machine learning methods are directly employable on IoT edge devices. In this paper, we analyze the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms for solving security problems (e.g. intrusion detection) at the edge. Starting from the characteristics and limitations of edge devices in IoT networks, we assess a selected set of commonly used ML algorithms based on four metrics: computation complexity, memory footprint, storage requirement and accuracy. We also compare the suitability of ML algorithms to different cybersecurity problems and discuss the possibility of utilizing these methods for use cases. © 2019 IEEE.

Due to this its vast applications and services, a huge addition using context aware devices has been seen in development of some sectors of applications and services. This set of devices generate huge amount of data that needs quick and technically precise security mechanism to protect all the generated data along with associated services. Complex event processing is an evolving trend that analyses contiguous streams of data using real time analysis. In this research article, a system to detect distributed intrusion attacks is developed and the quality of fulfilment is evaluated using Raspberry Pi.

Adaptive machine learning-based alarm reduction via edge computing for distributed intrusion detection systems	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059871551&doi=10.1002%2fcpe.5101&partnerID=40&md5=7636b60bc67c7344333bc9cc5b4deaeb	To protect assets and resources from being hacked, intrusion detection systems are widely implemented in organizations around the world. However, false alarms are one challenging issue for such systems, which would significantly degrade the effectiveness of detection and greatly increase the burden of analysis. To solve this problem, building an intelligent false alarm filter using machine learning classifiers is considered as one promising solution, where an appropriate algorithm can be selected in an adaptive way in order to maintain the filtration accuracy. By means of cloud computing, the task of adaptive algorithm selection can be offloaded to the cloud, whereas it could cause communication delay and increase additional burden. In this work, motivated by the advent of edge computing, we propose a framework to improve the intelligent false alarm reduction for DIDS based on edge computing devices. Our framework can provide energy efficiency as the data can be processed at the edge for shorter response time. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework can help reduce the workload for the central server and the delay as compared to the similar studies. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	distributed system; edge computing; intelligent false alarm filter; intrusion detection; machine learning	Adaptive algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Computer crime; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Errors; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Adaptive machine learning; Communication delays; Distributed intrusion detection systems; Distributed systems; False alarm reductions; False alarms; Filtration accuracies; Intrusion Detection Systems; Alarm systems
RAD-EI: A routing attack detection scheme for edge-based Internet of Things environment	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070692539&doi=10.1002%2fdac.4024&partnerID=40&md5=4f771c4e97a8830a2a08ba3e048d6974	Internet of Things (IoT) offers various types of application services in different domains, such as “smart infrastructure, health-care, critical infrastructure, and intelligent transportation system.” The name edge computing signifies a corner or edge in a network at which traffic enters or exits from the network. In edge computing, the data analysis task happens very close to the IoT smart sensors and devices. Edge computing can also speed up the analysis process, which allows decision makers to take action within a short duration of time. However, edge-based IoT environment has several security and privacy issues similar to those for the cloud-based IoT environment. Various types of attacks, such as “replay, man-in-the middle, impersonation, password guessing, routing attack, and other denial of service attacks” may be possible in edge-based IoT environment. The routing attacker nodes have the capability to deviate and disrupt the normal flow of traffic. These malicious nodes do not send packets (messages) to the edge node and only send packets to its neighbor collaborator attacker nodes. Therefore, in the presence of such kind of routing attack, edge node does not get the information or sometimes it gets the partial information. This further affects the overall performance of communication of edge-based IoT environment. In the presence of such an attack, the “throughput of the network” decreases, “end-to-end delay” increases, “packet delivery ratio” decreases, and other parameters also get affected. Consequently, it is important to provide solution for such kind of attack. In this paper, we design an intrusion detection scheme for the detection of routing attack in edge-based IoT environment called as RAD-EI. We simulate RAD-EI using the widely used “NS2 simulator” to measure different network parameters. Furthermore, we provide the security analysis of RAD-EI to prove its resilience against routing attacks. RAD-EI accomplishes around 95.0% “detection rate” and 1.23% “false positive rate” that are notably better than other related existing schemes. In addition, RAD-EI is efficient in terms of computation and communication costs. As a result, RAD-EI is a good match for some critical and sensitive applications, such as smart security and surveillance system. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	edge computing; intrusion detection; IoT; NS2; routing attack; security	Authentication; Decision making; Denial-of-service attack; Edge computing; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Network security; Security systems; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion detection scheme; Routing attacks; security; Security and privacy issues; Security and surveillances; Sensitive application; Internet of things
FBAD: Fog-based Attack Detection for IoT Healthcare in Smart Cities	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080107146&doi=10.1109%2fUEMCON47517.2019.8992963&partnerID=40&md5=5040730f8a38a80e4fefc70754cfca8b	The number of zero-day attacks has been exponentially increasing due to a variety of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) protocols. Many centralized-based techniques have been introduced to identify malicious activities in IoT environments. However, these techniques have suffered including a high latency to satisfy IoT requirements. This paper proposes a fog-based attack detection (FBAD) framework using an ensemble of online sequential extreme learning machine (EOS-ELM) for efficiently detecting malicious activities. We indicate a high-level view of the efficient proposed framework for deploying the distributed attack detection technique in fog computing due to high accuracy and low latency, as it is closer to the IoT devices at the network edge. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our framework with other existing approaches including ELM and OS-ELM. The results of the experiment demonstrate that distributed architecture outperforms centralized architecture in terms of the detection time and classification accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.

False data detection for fog and internet of things networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072783685&doi=10.3390%2fs19194235&partnerID=40&md5=d7dc8710c3b83b0512c31effc1a86c65	The Internet of Things (IoT) context brings new security issues due to billions of smart end-devices both interconnected in wireless networks and connected to the Internet by using different technologies. In this paper, we propose an attack-detection method, named Data Intrusion Detection System (DataIDS), based on real-time data analysis. As end devices are mainly resource constrained, Fog Computing (FC) is introduced to implement the DataIDS. FC increases storage, computation capabilities, and processing capabilities, allowing it to detect promptly an attack with respect to security solutions on the Cloud. This paper also considers an attack tree to model threats and vulnerabilities of Fog/IoT scenarios with heterogeneous devices and suggests countermeasure costs. We verify the performance of the proposed DataIDS, implementing a testbed with several devices that measure different physical quantities and by using standard data-gathering protocols. © 2019 by the authors.

High-performance, platform-independent DDoS detection for IoT ecosystems	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080898307&doi=10.1109%2fLCN44214.2019.8990862&partnerID=40&md5=7247d9049fa26eff75d9cc0c8d292b80	Most Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) detection and mitigation strategies for Internet of Things (IoT) are based on a remote cloud server or purpose-built middlebox executing complex intrusion detection methods, that impose stringent scalability and performance requirements on the IoT due to the vast amounts of traffic and devices to be handled. In this paper, we present an edge-based detection scheme using BPFabric, a high-speed, programmable data-plane switch architecture, and lightweight network functions to execute upstream anomaly detection. The proposed detection scheme ensures fast detection of DDoS attacks originated from IoT devices, while guaranteeing minimum resource usage and processing overhead.

Review of the D2D trusted cooperative mechanism in mobile edge computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071116376&doi=10.3390%2finfo10080259&partnerID=40&md5=02f473c09b254446631a36afaf4e2af2	Mobile edge computing (MEC) effectively integrates wireless network and Internet technologies and adds computing, storage, and processing functions to the edge of cellular networks. This new network architecture model can deliver services directly from the cloud to the very edge of the network while providing the best efficiency in mobile networks. However, due to the dynamic, open, and collaborative nature of MEC network environments, network security issues have become increasingly complex. Devices cannot easily ensure obtaining satisfactory and safe services because of the numerous, dynamic, and collaborative character of MEC devices and the lack of trust between devices. The trusted cooperative mechanism can help solve this problem. In this paper, we analyze the MEC network structure and device-to-device (D2D) trusted cooperative mechanism and their challenging issues and then discuss and compare different ways to establish the D2D trusted cooperative relationship in MEC, such as social trust, reputation, authentication techniques, and intrusion detection. All these ways focus on enhancing the efficiency, stability, and security of MEC services in presenting trustworthy services. © 2019 by the authors.

DNS/DANE collision-based distributed and dynamic authentication for microservices in IoT	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070747644&doi=10.3390%2fs19153292&partnerID=40&md5=6e780cd8f7a07f82fdc3f32487dbd39d	IoT devices provide real-time data to a rich ecosystem of services and applications. The volume of data and the involved subscribe/notify signaling will likely become a challenge also for access and core networks. To alleviate the core of the network, other technologies like fog computing can be used. On the security side, designers of IoT low-cost devices and applications often reuse old versions of development frameworks and software components that contain vulnerabilities. Many server applications today are designed using microservice architectures where components are easier to update. Thus, IoT can benefit from deploying microservices in the fog as it offers the required flexibility for the main players of ubiquitous computing: nomadic users. In such deployments, IoT devices need the dynamic instantiation of microservices. IoT microservices require certificates so they can be accessed securely. Thus, every microservice instance may require a newly-created domain name and a certificate. The DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) extension to Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) allows linking a certificate to a given domain name. Thus, the combination of DNSSEC and DANE provides microservices’ clients with secure information regarding the domain name, IP address, and server certificate of a given microservice. However, IoT microservices may be short-lived since devices can move from one local fog to another, forcing DNSSEC servers to sign zones whenever new changes occur. Considering DNSSEC and DANE were designed to cope with static services, coping with IoT dynamic microservice instantiation can throttle the scalability in the fog. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a solution that modifies the DNSSEC/DANE signature mechanism using chameleon signatures and defining a new soft delegation scheme. Chameleon signatures are signatures computed over a chameleon hash, which have a property: a secret trapdoor function can be used to compute collisions to the hash. Since the hash is maintained, the signature does not have to be computed again. In the soft delegation schema, DNS servers obtain a trapdoor that allows performing changes in a constrained zone without affecting normal DNS operation. In this way, a server can receive this soft delegation and modify the DNS zone to cope with frequent changes such as microservice dynamic instantiation. Changes in the soft delegated zone are much faster and do not require the intervention of the DNS primary servers of the zone. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

From back-of-the-envelope to informed estimation of edge computing benefits in minutes using castnet	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072937589&doi=10.1109%2fICFC.2019.00028&partnerID=40&md5=294658dce792b478c06448e97ef3638d	Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is emerging as the next evolution in computing infrastructure. However, the broad adoption of edge computing solutions is still lagging behind. We posit that a significant factor contributing to this trend is related to the challenges in evaluating the trade-offs offered by edge computing and answering a simple question: Will the edge investments be offset with commensurate gains in performance metrics such as improved application responsiveness or lower backhaul bandwidth costs? Existing simulation tools, developed for cloud computing and networking research, require a large amount of effort to be applied to the edge computing space. Their native abstractions and interfaces pose limitations in how such frameworks can be extended to allow for characterization and analysis of diverse edge computing use cases. Moreover, as we demonstrate, they can be slow, taking days, to provide insights. To address this gap, we develop Castnet - a fast, extensible, and easy-to-use framework for evaluating the benefits of MEC for different edge deployment models, configuration and functions. We demonstrate that Castnet leads to significant gains in the time-to-insight while achieving the same fidelity in the results as existing tools. We illustrate the utility of Castnet using two scenarios: an investigation of the impact of edge storage capacity for edge-based content caches, and the impact of edge location for an edge-based intrusion detection service. © 2019 IEEE.

This paradigm is changed with the advent of the Industrial Internet of Things that foresees flexible and interconnected systems. In this contribution, a device acting as a connection between the operational technology network and information technology network is proposed. The device is an intrusion detection system related to legacy systems that is able to collect and reporting data to and from industrial IoT devices. It is based on the common signature based intrusion detection system developed in the information technology domain, however, to cope with the constraints of the operation technology domain, it exploits anomaly based features. Specifically, it is able to analyze the traffic on the network at application layer by mean of deep packet inspection, parsing the information carried by the proprietary protocols. At a later stage, it collect and aggregate data from and to IoT domain. A simple set up is considered to prove the effectiveness of the approach. © 2019 IEEE.

Intrusion detection for IoT devices based on RF fingerprinting using deep learning	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071661933&doi=10.1109%2fFMEC.2019.8795319&partnerID=40&md5=bd29f0d5095ab63fb89a5fb5461b6652	Internet of Things (IoT) and 4G/5G wireless networks have added huge number of devices and new services, where commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) IoT devices have been deployed extensively. To ensure secure operations of these systems with wireless transmission capabilities, Radio Frequency (RF) surveillance is important to monitor their activities in RF spectrum and detect unauthorized IoT devices. Specifically, in order to prevent an adversary from impersonating legitimate users using identical devices from the same manufacturer, unique 'signatures' must be obtained for every individual device in order to uniquely identify each device. In this study, a novel intrusion detection method is proposed to detect unauthorized IoT devices using deep learning. The proposed method is based on RF fingerprinting since physical layer based features are device specific and more difficult to impersonate. RF traces are collected from six 'identical' ZigBee devices via a USRP based test bed. The traces span a range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio, to ensure robustness of the model. A convolutional neural network is used to extract features from the RF traces, and dimension reduction and de-correlation are performed on the extracted features. The reduced features are then clustered to identify IoT devices. We show that the proposed method is able to identify devices that are not observed during training. The results not only highlight the benefit of deep learning based feature extraction, but also show promising prospects for being able to distinguish new devices (classes) that are not observed during training. © 2019 IEEE.

Low-Rate DoS Attack Detection Using PSD Based Entropy and Machine Learning	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074142814&doi=10.1109%2fCSCloud%2fEdgeCom.2019.00020&partnerID=40&md5=3f1ea977d12fde38841220e34141b469	The Distributed Denial of Service attack is one of the most common attacks and it is hard to mitigate, however, it has become more difficult while dealing with the Low-rate DoS (LDoS) attacks. The LDoS exploits the vulnerability of TCP congestion-control mechanism by sending malicious traffic at the low constant rate and influence the victim machine. Recently, machine learning approaches are applied to detect the complex DDoS attacks and improve the efficiency and robustness of the intrusion detection system. In this research, the algorithm is designed to balance the detection rate and its efficiency. The detection algorithm combines the Power Spectral Density (PSD) entropy function and Support Vector Machine to detect LDoS traffic from normal traffic. In our solution, the detection rate and efficiency are adjustable based on the parameter in the decision algorithm. To have high efficiency, the detection method will always detect the attacks by calculating PSD-entropy first and compare it with the two adaptive thresholds. The thresholds can efficiently filter nearly 19% of the samples with a high detection rate. To minimize the computational cost and look only for the patterns that are most relevant for detection, Support Vector Machine based machine learning model is applied to learn the traffic pattern and select appropriate features for detection algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can detect 99.19% of the LDoS attacks and has an O (n log n) time complexity in the best case. © 2019 IEEE.

VProVal: Introspection based process validation for detecting malware in KVM-based cloud environment	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071660883&doi=10.1109%2fFMEC.2019.8795365&partnerID=40&md5=8c9a7f6ca9792cd713118ebdeac0d646	In the modern era of computing, Cloud security is of paramount importance. Most of the research mainly focused on In-Virtual Machine (VM) security techniques for detecting malware affecting virtual domains running in the Cloud. In-VM security techniques are deployed inside the VM and hence they are very much prone to subversion attacks. In this paper, an-VM monitoring approach based on introspection, called vProVal, is proposed. The vProVal is designed to detect the hidden processes and rootkits that disable the security tool, running in the monitored VM in Kernel VM (KVM)-based cloud environment. It performs the malware detection from outside the VM at the KVM-layer and hence more robust to attacks. The introspection technique used is to extract the low-level details of a running VM from hypervisor by viewing its memory, trapping on hardware events, and accessing the vCPU registers. A preliminary analysis has been performed and the approach is found to be promising. © 2019 IEEE.

Scalable Poisoning against Regression-Type Edge Computing Applications via An Approximate Optimization Strategy	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087632564&doi=10.1109%2fINFOCOMWKSHPS47286.2019.9093771&partnerID=40&md5=e8449c33c8306fd76f2fe622b2f9c5ad	As the machine learning technology is being widely used in next-generation networks aided by edge computing, its security is of great concern for network maintenance and management. On the other hand, intelligent data processing techniques for enhancing the performance of next-generation networks are mainly used to reinforce resource management, control and optimization. Therefore, compared to learning a classifier for other application scenarios (e.g., pattern recognition, network intrusion detection, image identification, etc.), learning a good regressor via machine learning is more valuable for edge computing applications in next-generation networks. Hence, we revisit the security of polynomial regression learning in this paper and propose a scalable poisoning method against regression-type edge computing applications via an approximate optimization strategy. Specifically, we first analyze the existing gradientbased optimization poisoning method (called OptP) against linear regression model. Then, we extend the method and give a formal description of poisoning against polynomial regression with order greater than one. After that, we propose a greedy optimization strategy to obtain good adversarial examples for compromising polynomial regression-type applications. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed poisoning method by applying it to attack against two synthetic data sets and three public data sets from three different application scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.

In this paper we mainly concentrate on wireless devices which will be connected in a network, we call it internet. This phenomenon is nothing but internet of things. There are vulnerabilities for networks and the devices which can be compromised by using attacks. These vulnerabilities has raised the importance for the data protection. This situation is to be dealt with Intrusion detection system. So we need an IDS to check for the authentication and maintaining security of the data. IDS acts as a bridge between the IOT devices and Internet. This IDS comprises of a device along with a software to check for authentication. Final goal of this paper is to achieve a secured IOT network. Identification and Authentication play an important role in this process. © BEIESP.

The present paper focuses on discovering viable anomalies that have a significant potential to be associated with abnormal network behavior. Three approaches based on ML (Machine Learning) have been proposed to detect suspicious network behavior. These methods are an extension of the techniques discussed as part of the introduction below. The developed approaches in the current paper are evaluated by testing their efficiency against a real-time network attack using available open-source network tools. The results of the experiment demonstrate successful identification of anomalous instances from the telemetry data with a low false alarm rate. Further, we believe that our approaches can be directly deployed in a real-time environment (independently on the edge device or over the cloud) to strengthen the network security. © 2019 IEEE.

Only there are few companies concentrating on Security measures implemented on Edge Node. Gartner estimates that by 2020, more than 25 percent of all enterprise attackers will make use of the Industrial IoT. As Cyber Security Threat is getting more important, it is essential to ensure protection of data both at rest and at motion. The reflex of Cyber Security in the Industrial IoT Domain is much more severe when compared to the Consumer IoT Segment. The new bottleneck in this are security services which employ computationally intensive software operations and system services [1]. Resilient services consume considerable resources in a design. When such measures are added to thwart security attacks, the resource requirements grow even more demanding. Since the standard IIoT Gateways and other sub devices are resource constrained in nature the conventional design for security services will not be applicable in this case. This paper proposes an intelligent architectural paradigm for the Constrained IIoT Gateways that can efficiently identify the Cyber-Attacks in the Industrial IoT domain. © 2019 IEEE.

A lightweight perceptron-based intrusion detection system for fog computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059548862&doi=10.3390%2fapp9010178&partnerID=40&md5=7f1523dc011a114cc75949833bfde319	Fog computing is a paradigm that extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network in order to address the inherent problems of the cloud, such as latency and lack of mobility support and location-awareness. The fog is a decentralized platform capable of operating and processing data locally and can be installed in heterogeneous hardware which makes it ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are an integral part of any security system for fog and IoT networks to ensure the quality of service. Due to the resource limitations of fog and IoT devices, lightweight IDS is highly desirable. In this paper, we present a lightweight IDS based on a vector space representation using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. We evaluated the presented IDS against the Australian Defense Force Academy Linux Dataset (ADFA-LD) and Australian Defense Force AcademyWindows Dataset (ADFA-WD), which are new generation system calls datasets that contain exploits and attacks on various applications. The simulation shows that by using a single hidden layer and a small number of nodes, we are able to achieve a 94% Accuracy, 95% Recall, and 92% F1-Measure in ADFA-LD and 74% Accuracy, 74% Recall, and 74% F1-Measure in ADFA-WD.

Node State Monitoring Scheme in Fog Radio Access Networks for Intrusion Detection	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062834756&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2899017&partnerID=40&md5=54c7f3efc85a94ce190533e97d563cba	This paper studies intrusion detection for fog computing in fog radio access networks (F-RANs). As fog nodes are resource constrained, a traditional intrusion detection system (IDS) cannot be directly deployed in F-RANs due to the communication overhead and computational complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a skyline query-based scheme that can analyze the IDS log statistics of fog nodes and provide a complete data processing flow. Specifically, a three-step solution is proposed. First, a lightweight fog node filtering strategy is proposed to filter the raw data, which can reduce the fog-cloud communication overhead. Second, a sliding-window-based mechanism is developed in the cloud server to efficiently process the asynchronous data flow. Then, using the pre-processed data, a set of seriously attacked nodes will be identified by the skyline query. Third, the security threat level of each individual fog node is calculated using the unascertained measure, which can determine the degree of security threat. The numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce communication overhead and computational complexity. © 2019 IEEE.	5G; FNFS; fog computing; IDS; node monitoring; skyline query	Complex networks; Computational complexity; Cost reduction; Fog; Intrusion detection; Network security; Radio access networks; Security systems; Cloud communications; Communication overheads; FNFS; Intrusion Detection Systems; Pre-processed data; Skyline query; Sliding window-based; Unascertained measure; Fog computing
HMM-Based Secure Framework for Optical Fog Devices in the Optical Fog/Cloud Network	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071569165&doi=10.1515%2fjoc-2019-0155&partnerID=40&md5=8acca17acb3a1f49533580eb28774962	In the present optical fog/cloud computing environment, optical line terminals and optical network units are used as the most promising optical fog devices (OFDs). The inherent characteristics of fog computing provide certain granted privileges to the attacker to hack devices and make them malicious. Also, existing security solutions generate false alarms that affect the performance of the underlying network. In this paper, a secure framework is proposed that not only predicts the malicious OFDs but also reduces false alarms. Hidden Markov model and intrusion detection system are used to detect the malicious one by computing the probability of shifting (POS) and then shift it to the virtual honeypot which is kept hidden by deploying it at the optical fog layer. In addition, it also reduces the generation of false alarm and logs all malicious activities for further analysis. In the experiment section, Python is used to validate the proposed framework.

Intrusion detection at the network edge: Solutions, limitations, and future directions	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068118555&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-23374-7_5&partnerID=40&md5=1ff685015b4c764da117f10fe4ab0f39	The low-latency, high bandwidth capabilities promised by 5G, together with the diffusion of applications that require high computing power and, again, low latency (such as videogames), are probably the main reasons—though not the only one—that have led to the introduction of a new network architecture: Fog Computing, that consists in moving the computation services geographically close to where computing is needed. This architectural shift moves security and privacy issues from the Cloud to the different layers of the Fog architecture. In this scenario, IDSs are still necessary, but they need to be contextualized in the new architecture. Indeed, while on the one hand Fog computing provides intrinsic benefits (e.g., low latency), on the other hand, it introduces new design challenges. In this paper, we provide the following contributions: we analyze the possible IDS solutions that can be adopted within the different Fog computing tiers, together with their related deployment and design challenges; and, we propose some promising future directions, by taking into account the challenges left uncovered by the considered solutions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.		5G mobile communication systems; Computer architecture; Edge computing; Fog; Intrusion detection; Network architecture; Network security; Computation service; Computing power; Design challenges; Different layers; High bandwidth; Low latency; Network edges; Security and privacy issues; Fog computing

A New Resource Allocation Mechanism for Security of Mobile Edge Computing System	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077433843&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2936374&partnerID=40&md5=061a6cb5c66c4c7f513c27fb77451da7	Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC) is a new computing paradigm that provides a capillary distribution of cloud computing capabilities to the network edge. In this paper, we studied the security defense problem in MEC network environment. One big challenge is how to efficiently allocate resources to deploy Mobile-Edge Computing-Intrusion Detection Systems (MEC-IDS) in this system, since all the MEC hosts are composed of resource-constrained network devices. To tackle this challenge, a new resource allocation mechanism based on deterministic differential equation model is proposed and investigated. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the positive solution of this model are obtained by using Lyapuonv stability theory. Furthermore, we extended our study to MEC network environment with stochastic perturbation and established a new stochastic differential equation model. We proved the existence, uniqueness, persistence and oscillatory of the positive solution of this model and quantitatively analyzed the relationship between oscillation and intensity of stochastic perturbation. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the main results. © 2013 IEEE.	intrusion detection systems; Mobile-edge computing; resource allocation; stability theory; stochastic perturbation	Differential equations; Edge computing; Intrusion detection; Network security; Resource allocation; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Allocation mechanism; Differential equation model; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network environments; Resource-constrained network; Stability theories; Stochastic differential equation models; Stochastic perturbations; Computation theory
Intrusion Detection Classification Model on an Improved k-Dependence Bayesian Network	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077977270&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2949890&partnerID=40&md5=ee305a711d8a7e443c65c38545f5a0bc	Edge computing extends traditional cloud services to the edge of the network, and the highly dynamic and heterogeneous environment at the edge of the network makes the network security situation facing severe challenges. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study and build a high-precision Intrusion Detection Classification Model (IDCM) for network security in the emerging edge computing mode. This paper studies an improved k-dependency Bayesian network (KDBN) structural model that can accurately describe the dependence relationships among system variables and reduce the complexity of the Bayesian network structure by reducing the directed edges of weak dependence. On this basis, this paper constructs an IDCM based on improved KDBN by introducing the maximum a posterior criterion and a virtual augmentation method for samples of small category. The experiments use the KDDCup99 (10%) intrusion detection data set for verification, which show that the IDCM based on improved KDBN has high efficiency, high detection accuracy and high stability, which optimally addresses the issues discussed in many references, such as low detection accuracy and poor stability, for small categories (U2R and R2L) in the KDDCup99 (10%) intrusion detection data set. © 2013 IEEE.

Fog-cloud distributed intrusion detection and cooperation	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076152831&doi=10.1002%2fett.3835&partnerID=40&md5=a06999cf2617fa462a4c5ab758ca2ba2	Cloud computing is becoming a promoted technology. Over the recent years, it has rapidly grown and its adoption is more and more increasing. Many enterprizes and organizations have immigrated their data to the cloud. However, the security of this technology is considered a serious barrier to guarantee the organizations' trust on it. Therefore, intrusion detection has been set as the best solution to secure the cloud platform. Thus, many research studies have been developed for the aim to create an effective and performing intrusion detection system suitable for the cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a new approach for cloud environment–based multilevel cooperation in terms of intrusion detection. It is based on the cooperation and the correlation between fog nodes at the beginning and then between fog and cloud technology. We also evaluate the performance and the efficiency of this proposed prototype in terms of detection rates and detection response to make real-time detection in the whole cloud platform. The results show that the proposed architecture introduces low false positive rate compared to the existing hybrid intrusion detection approach in cloud computing (HIDCC) framework. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This is due to the deployment of faster network access technologies, innovative network reliant applications and leading edge devices like smart phones, tablets and Internet of Things (IoT). Applications running on these devices are increasing the dependency of high speed network services. Nonetheless, the main objective of DDoS attacks are to deprive legitimate users of network services by exhausting a victim’s bandwidth or hardware resources. Most current approaches offer centralized detection and mitigation. However, few proposals focus on deploying DDoS defense and mitigation systems within the ISP’s domain, which has the potential to provide scalable and distributed solutions for these attacks.

Hypergraph clustering model-based association analysis of DDOS attacks in fog computing intrusion detection system	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055356010&doi=10.1186%2fs13638-018-1267-2&partnerID=40&md5=f9a9026a4a5c7a81f5963798520aafff	The birth of fog computing has given rise to many security threats. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks by intruders on fog nodes will cause system resources to be illegally appropriate. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a powerful technology that can be used to resist DDoS attacks. In our previous research, we have proposed a fog computing intrusion detection system (FC-IDS) framework. In this paper, we mainly analyze and model the DDoS attacks under the framework of FC-IDS. We propose a hypergraph clustering model based on Apriori algorithm. This model can effectively describe the association between fog nodes which are suffering from the threat of DDoS. Through simulation, we verify that the resource utilization rate of the system can be effectively promoted through the DDoS association analysis. © 2018, The Author(s).

A fog-based privacy-preserving approach for distributed signature-based intrusion detection	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050884878&doi=10.1016%2fj.jpdc.2018.07.013&partnerID=40&md5=a4bc1dde4aae01d6f4da4db67fb0777b	Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are the frontier of defense against transmissible cyber threats that spread across distributed systems. Modern IDSs overcome the limitation of hardware processing power by offloading computation extensive operations such as signature matching to the cloud. Moreover, in order to prevent the rapid spread of transmissible cyber threats, collaborative intrusion detection schemes are widely deployed to allow distributed IDS nodes to exchange information with each other. However, no party wants to disclose their own data during the detection process, especially sensitive user data to others, even the cloud providers for privacy concerns. In this background, privacy-preserving technology has been researched in the field of intrusion detection, whereas a collaborative intrusion detection network (CIDN) environment still lacks of appropriate solutions due to its geographical distribution. With the advent of fog computing, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving framework for signature-based intrusion detection in a distributed network based on fog devices. The results in both simulated and real environments demonstrate that our proposed framework can help reserve the privacy of shared data, reduce the workload on the cloud side, and offer less detection delay as compared to similar approaches. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Fair Resource Allocation in an Intrusion-Detection System for Edge Computing Ensuring the Security of Internet of Things Devices	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051599522&doi=10.1109%2fMCE.2018.2851723&partnerID=40&md5=0099fb04786e0134c78119ca6b5de084	The recent trend of edge computing extends cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) to the edge of the network. Similar to most systems, an intrusion-detection system (IDS) is commonly used to mitigate cybersecurity threats in edge computing. Due to the limitations in edge nodes (e.g., in terms of computational and storage capabilities), efficient and fair resource allocation within an IDS is challenging. This article studies IDS architecture and resource allocation in edge computing. Specifically, the proposed system is designed to facilitate multiple resources sharing and heterogeneous resource-demanding allocation. A general edge computing IDS architecture is presented, and we use this as the basis for our model for allocating resources. Then, a single-layer dominant and max-min fair (SDMMF) allocation is used, which has been theoretically proven to satisfy all hierarchical resource allocation properties, and a multilayer resource allocation scheme [in our system, the multilayer dominant and max-min fair (MDMMF) allocation] is used to cope with the multiple resources fair allocation in multiple layers. © 2012 IEEE.

Towards the transversal detection of DDoS network attacks in 5G multi-tenant overlay networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053399301&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2018.07.017&partnerID=40&md5=25580d8a9010cb5c470dadb8773df35e	Currently, there is no any effective security solution which can detect cyber-attacks against 5G networks where multitenancy and user mobility are some unique characteristics that impose significant challenges over such security solutions. This paper focuses on addressing a transversal detection system to be able to protect at the same time, infrastructures, tenants and 5G users in both edge and core network segments of the 5G multi-tenant infrastructures. A novel approach which significantly extends the capabilities of a commonly used IDS, to accurately identify attacking nodes in a 5G network, regardless of multiple network traffic encapsulations, has been proposed in this paper. The proposed approach is suitable to be deployed in almost all 5G network segments including the Mobile Edge Computing. Both architectural design and data models are described in this contribution. Empirical experiments have been carried out a realistic 5G multi-tenant infrastructures to intensively validate the design of the proposed approach regarding scalability and flexibility. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd	5G network; DDoS attack; Intrusion detection system; Multi-tenant; Security	5G mobile communication systems; Denial-of-service attack; Intrusion detection; Overlay networks; Queueing networks; 5g networks; DDoS Attack; Intrusion Detection Systems; Multi tenants; Security; Network security
Secure, Resilient, and Self-Configuring Fog Architecture for Untrustworthy IoT Environments	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054087800&doi=10.1109%2fTrustCom%2fBigDataSE.2018.00018&partnerID=40&md5=fe21fbda993c0c476cad011801278f11	The extensive increase in the number of IoT devices and the massive data generated and sent to the cloud hinder the cloud abilities to handle it. Further, some IoT devices are latency-sensitive. Such sensitivity makes it harder for far clouds to handle the IoT needs in a timely manner. A new technology named 'Fog computing' has emerged as a solution to such problems. Fog computing relies on close by computational devices to handle the conventional cloud load. However, Fog computing introduced additional problems related to the trustworthiness and safety of such devices. Unfortunately, the suggested architectures did not consider such problem. In this paper we present a novel self-configuring fog architecture to support IoT networks with security and trust in mind. We realize the concept of Moving-target defense by mobilizing the applications inside the fog using live migrations. Performance evaluations using a benchmark for mobilized applications showed that the added overhead of live migrations is very small making it deployable in real scenarios. Finally, we presented a mathematical model to estimate the survival probabilities of both static and mobile applications within the fog. Moreover, this work can be extended to other systems such as mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETS) or in vehicular cloud computing (VCC). © 2018 IEEE.

Not only are these capabilities fundamental to avoid regulatory fines upward of a million a day, they also help ensure the overall security, safety, and reliability of the grid. Often thought of as mutually exclusive, this paper shows that through advanced passive security monitoring, asset owners can maintain, in real-time, an accurate and up-to-date asset inventory list while also protecting the grid's edge from cyber threats. By stepping through the different use-cases for passive network security monitoring, the paper demonstrates how asset owners can reach a higher return on their investment in such a way that is technically, economically, and operationally feasible. © 2018 IEEE.

Then, we consider the issues and design a framework and accompanying mechanisms for performing trustworthy computing making use of the vertical IoT cloud structure to secure the IoT cloud in vertical and horizontal computation structures. Specifically, we discuss a general trustworthy computing pattern in the IoT cloud and use intrusion detection as an example to illustrate the idea, develop an advanced access control and policy definition model for highly dynamic IoT networks, and introduce an integrated data provenance and information control mechanism to assure the data integrity and secure the information flow for various computation patterns in the IoT cloud. © 2018 IEEE.

With rapidly growing number of connected devices in IoT, the scope for cyber-attack also increases exponentially. Therefore an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) is needed to efficiently detect the attack at faster rate in highly scalable and dynamic IoT environment. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique is proposed based on fog computing using Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) which can intelligently interpret the attacks from the IoT traffic. In the proposed system, the existing centralized cloud intelligence in detecting the attack is distributed to local fog nodes to detect the attack at faster rate for IoT application. The distributed architecture of fog computing enables distributed intrusion detection mechanism with scalability, flexibility and interoperability. The analysis of the proposed system proves to be efficient in terms of response time and detection accuracy. © 2018 KICS.

A novel framework for collaborative intrusion detection for M2M networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048495114&doi=10.1109%2fIACS.2018.8355434&partnerID=40&md5=5af141cd943030e0b9f2c5c943289b2c	The proliferation of sensor devices has introduced exciting possibilities such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Machine to Machine (M2M) communication underpins efficient interactions within such infrastructures. The resource constraints and ad-hoc nature of these networks have significant implications for security in general and with respect to intrusion detection in particular. Consequently, contemporary solutions mandating a stable infrastructure are inadequate to fulfill these defining characteristics of M2M networks. In this paper, we present COLIDE (COLlaborative Intrusion Detection Engine) a novel framework for effective intrusion detection in the M2M networks without incurring high energy and communication cost on the participating host and edge nodes. The framework is envisioned to address challenges such as flexibility, resource constraints, and the collaborative nature of the M2M networks. The paper presents a detailed system description along with its formal and empirical evaluation using Contiki OS. Our evaluation for different communication scenarios demonstrates that the proposed approach has limited overhead in terms of energy utilization and memory consumption. © 2018 IEEE.

A cybersecurity framework to identify malicious edge device in fog computing and cloud-of-things environments	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029784320&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2017.08.016&partnerID=40&md5=3dc65fbc3357b590304d81cc5b9de88c	Device security is one of the major challenges for successful implementation of Internet of Things and fog computing environment in current IT space. Researchers and Information Technology (IT) organizations have explored many solutions to protect systems from unauthenticated device attacks (known as outside device attacks). Fog computing uses network devices (e.g. router, switch and hub) for latency-aware processing of collected data using IoT. Then, identification of malicious edge device is one of the critical activities in data security of fog computing environment. Preventing attacks from malicious edge devices in fog computing environment is more difficult because they have certain granted privileges to use and process the data. In this paper, proposed cybersecurity framework uses three technologies which are Markov model, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Virtual Honeypot Device (VHD) to identify malicious edge device in fog computing environment. A two-stage hidden Markov model is used to effectively categorize edge devices in four different levels. VHD is designed to store and maintain log repository of all identified malicious devices which assists the system to defend itself from any unknown attacks in the future. Proposed cybersecurity framework is tested with real attacks in virtual environment created using OpenStack and Microsoft Azure. Results indicated that proposed cybersecurity framework is successful in identifying the malicious device as well as reducing the false IDS alarm rate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	Edge device; Fog computing; Internet of Things; Intrusion detection system; Two-stage Markov model; Virtual Honeypot Device	Computer crime; Data handling; Fog; Hidden Markov models; Internet of things; Markov processes; Mercury (metal); Network function virtualization; Network security; Virtual reality; Windows operating system; Computing environments; Critical activities; Edge device; Honeypots; Intrusion Detection Systems; Log Repositories; Markov model; Unknown attacks; Intrusion detection
Multistage Signaling Game-Based Optimal Detection Strategies for Suppressing Malware Diffusion in Fog-Cloud-Based IoT Networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040924123&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2018.2795549&partnerID=40&md5=db9ab0ee90bbedec5d81f780dce4569b	We consider the Internet of Things (IoT) with malware diffusion and seek optimal malware detection strategies for preserving the privacy of smart objects in IoT networks and suppressing malware diffusion. To this end, we propose a malware detection infrastructure realized by an intrusion detection system (IDS) with cloud and fog computing to overcome the IDS deployment problem in smart objects due to their limited resources and heterogeneous subnetworks. We then employ a signaling game to disclose interactions between smart objects and the corresponding fog node because of malware uncertainty in smart objects. To minimize privacy leakage of smart objects, we also develop optimal strategies that maximize malware detection probability by theoretically computing the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the game. Moreover, we analyze the factors influencing the optimal probability of a malicious smart object diffusing malware, and factors influencing the performance of a fog node in determining an infected smart object. Finally, we present a framework to demonstrate a potential and practical application of suppressing malware diffusion in IoT networks. © 2018 IEEE.

Anomaly behavior analysis for IoT sensors	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018983412&doi=10.1002%2fett.3188&partnerID=40&md5=feba1124289bdba1f772dbd0d49940e1	The Internet of Things (IoT) will not only connect computers and mobile devices but also interconnect smart buildings, homes, and cities, as well as electrical grids, gas, and water networks, automobiles, airplanes, etc. IoT will lead to the development of a wide range of advanced information services that need to be processed in real time and require large storage and computational power. The integration of IoT with fog and cloud computing not only brings the computational requirements but also enables IoT services to be pervasive, cost-effective, and accessible from anywhere and at anytime. In any IoT application, sensors are indispensable to bring the physical world into the digital world that can be implemented by leveraging fog computing. However, IoT sensors will introduce major security challenges as they contribute to a significant increase in the IoT attack surface. In this paper, we present a methodology to develop an intrusion detection system on the basis of anomaly behavior analysis to detect when a sensor has been compromised and used to provide misinformation. Our preliminary experimental results show that our approach can accurately authenticate sensors on the basis of their behavior and can detect known and unknown sensor attacks with high detection rate and low false alarms.

Intrusion detection system based on decision tree over big data in fog environment	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046296824&doi=10.1155%2f2018%2f4680867&partnerID=40&md5=9487c7f452bc925acd5def3bff476994	Fog computing, as the supplement of cloud computing, can provide low-latency services between mobile users and the cloud. However, fog devices may encounter security challenges as a result of the fog nodes being close to the end users and having limited computing ability. Traditional network attacks may destroy the system of fog nodes. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a proactive security protection technology and can be used in the fog environment. Although IDS in tradition network has been well investigated, unfortunately directly using them in the fog environment may be inappropriate. Fog nodes produce massive amounts of data at all times, and, thus, enabling an IDS system over big data in the fog environment is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose an IDS system based on decision tree. Firstly, we propose a preprocessing algorithm to digitize the strings in the given dataset and then normalize the whole data, to ensure the quality of the input data so as to improve the efficiency of detection. Secondly, we use decision tree method for our IDS system, and then we compare this method with Naïve Bayesian method as well as KNN method. Both the 10% dataset and the full dataset are tested. Our proposed method not only completely detects four kinds of attacks but also enables the detection of twenty-two kinds of attacks. The experimental results show that our IDS system is effective and precise. Above all, our IDS system can be used in fog computing environment over big data. © 2018 Kai Peng et al.

A detection and prevention technique for man in the middle attack in fog computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058295551&doi=10.1016%2fj.procs.2018.10.125&partnerID=40&md5=428d56af561dedd4a4326eb1485609ed	Due to the large number of IoT devices available, data needed to be processed by cloud service providers has grown exponentially. This leads to increase in the latency of cloud services and by extension latency in many IoT applications. To reduce this latency, computing devices are installed at the edge of the network close to the user. These devices are called ?Fog Nodes'. They allow the user to process some data without going all the way to the data center. While the data centers are equipped with abundant resources (i.e. processors, energy and memory), the fog devices are not. This means traditional techniques for preventing intrusion are not applicable at the fog level, because they will incur more latency and/or energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need for low resource demanding, yet strong security system that will protect the fog layer from being attacked. This paper proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for Man in the Middle (MitM) attack at the fog layer. The IDS consists of IDS nodes that periodically interrogate nodes one hop away. The IPS uses lightweight encryption to prevent Man in the Middle attack and its variants (i.e. Eavesdropping, Packet Modification and Wormhole attack). © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sample selected extreme learning machine based intrusion detection in fog computing and MEC	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048854265&doi=10.1155%2f2018%2f7472095&partnerID=40&md5=ace4351f9524c890f026ced5c7b90e65	"Fog computing, as a new paradigm, has many characteristics that are different from cloud computing. Due to the resources being limited, fog nodes/MEC hosts are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Lightweight intrusion detection system (IDS) is a key technique to solve the problem. Because extreme learning machine (ELM) has the characteristics of fast training speed and good generalization ability, we present a new lightweight IDS called sample selected extreme learning machine (SS-ELM). The reason why we propose ""sample selected extreme learningmachine"" is that fog nodes/MEC hosts do not have the ability to store extremely large amounts of training data sets.Accordingly, they are stored, computed, and sampled by the cloud servers.Then, the selected sample is given to the fog nodes/MEC hosts for training. This design can bring down the training time and increase the detection accuracy. Experimental simulation verifies that SS-ELM performs well in intrusion detection in terms of accuracy, training time, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) value.

A Novel Differential Game Model-Based Intrusion Response Strategy in Fog Computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051591685&doi=10.1155%2f2018%2f1821804&partnerID=40&md5=375991c8d331d514bca98dc18b8a72ff	Fog computing is an emerging network paradigm. Due to its characteristics (e.g., geo-location and constrained resource), fog computing is subject to a broad range of security threats. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an essential security technology to deal with the security threats in fog computing. We have introduced a fog computing IDS (FC-IDS) framework in our previous work. In this paper, we study the optimal intrusion response strategy in fog computing based on the FC-IDS scheme proposed in our previous work. We postulate the intrusion process in fog computing and describe it with a mathematical model based on differential game theory. According to this model, the optimal response strategy is obtained corresponding to the optimal intrusion strategy. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our security model can effectively stabilize the intrusion frequency of the invaders in fog computing. © 2018 Xingshuo An et al.

Enhancing intelligent alarm reduction for distributed intrusion detection systems via edge computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049782046&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-93638-3_44&partnerID=40&md5=ea47e8711b1a5d3d7e80e47dba397e9d	To construct an intelligent alarm filter is a promising solution to help reduce false alarms for an intrusion detection system (IDS), in which an appropriate algorithm can be selected in an adaptive way. Taking the advantage of cloud computing, the process of algorithm selection can be offloaded to the cloud, but it may cause communication delay and additional burden on the cloud side. This issue may become worse when it comes to distributed intrusion detection systems (DIDSs), i.e., some IoT applications might require very short response time and most of the end nodes in IoT are energy constrained things. In this paper, with the advent of edge computing, we propose a framework for improving the intelligent false alarm reduction for DIDSs based on edge computing devices (i.e., the data can be processed at the edge for shorter response time and could be more energy efficient). The evaluation shows that the proposed framework can help reduce the workload for the central server and shorten the delay as compared to the similar studies. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

To provide a highly secured network environment, network threat detection systems must handle real-time big data from varied places in enterprise networks. In this paper, we introduce a streaming-based threat detection system that can rapidly analyse highly intensive network traffic data in real-time, utilising streaming-based clustering algorithms to detect abnormal network activities. The developed system integrates the high-performance data analysis capabilities of Flume, Spark and Hadoop into a cloud-computing environment to provide network monitoring and intrusion detection. Our performance evaluation validates that the developed system can cope with a significant volume of streaming data in a high detection accuracy and good system performance. We further extend our system for edge computing and discuss some key challenges, as well as some potential solutions, aiming to improve the scalability of our system.

Fog-Assisted SDN Controlled Framework for Enduring Anomaly Detection in an IoT Network	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057853530&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2018.2884293&partnerID=40&md5=927c61f120ac844ab00a8cf1b6bd9121	Extensive adoption of intelligent devices with ubiquitous connectivity has increased Internet of Things (IoT) traffic tremendously. The smart devices promise to improve human life through improved safety and security through the implementation of intelligent transportation systems, optimization of power grids, and applications in human health. Devices produce a large amount of data for analytic applications running inside a cloud infrastructure. Unlike core networks, the main objective of an attack on an IoT network is to disrupt the availability of IoT data for the applications by overwhelming devices with information requests. Detection of such an attack cannot be done either in the cloud where the analytical application runs nor on the IoT device itself due to its limited computational resources. Furthermore, the standard networking paradigm does not provide an easy way to instrument and control networking nodes, for an effective mitigation of identified threats. In this paper, we propose a fog-assisted software defined networking (SDN) driven intrusion detection/prevention system (IDPS) for IoT networks. A collocated fog computational arrangement with IoT network equips proposed IDPS for timely identification of various attack models in near real time for effective neutralization of threats using SDN control. We have found our approach more effective from traditional techniques of intrusion detection in the IoT network. © 2013 IEEE.	anomaly; fog; intrusion detection; IoT; machine learning; network security; SDN	Computer crime; Edge detection; Electric power transmission networks; Entropy; Feature extraction; Fog; Fog computing; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Analytical applications; Anomaly; Computational resources; Image edge detection; Intelligent transportation systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Intrusion detection/prevention systems; Software defined networking (SDN); Internet of things
Securing cloud by mitigating insider data theft attacks with decoy technology using Hadoop	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047856614&doi=10.14419%2fijet.v7i2.31.13407&partnerID=40&md5=1882bcc94adc67c572c7440c40d06ce9	Cloud Computing has been intrinsically changing the way we utilize computers to keep and retrieve our personal & business data. With the advent of this emerging paradigm of computing, it arises the new security challenges. Existent cryptographic data security techniques i.e., encryption deteriorated in preventing data theft attacks once the key is compromised, especially those perpetrated by insiders. Cloud Security Alliance reckoned this threat as a significant danger of Cloud Computing. Although the majority of Cloud users are very much known of this risk, they are leftover with the only choice of trusting the cloud service provider, regards to their data protection. In this paper, we propose an alternate way to secure data on the cloud which is more efficient and secure by the concoction of user profile mapping using Hadoop framework and offensive decoy technology. © 2018 Authors.

Leveraging LSTM Networks for Attack Detection in Fog-to-Things Communications	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053460536&doi=10.1109%2fMCOM.2018.1701270&partnerID=40&md5=c4f7e3c89ae404549575cd1c10f7c87e	The evolution and sophistication of cyber-attacks need resilient and evolving cybersecurity schemes. As an emerging technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) inherits cyber-attacks and threats from the IT environment despite the existence of a layered defensive security mechanism. The extension of the digital world to the physical environment of IoT brings unseen attacks that require a novel lightweight and distributed attack detection mechanism due to their architecture and resource constraints. Architecturally, fog nodes can be leveraged to offload security functions from IoT and the cloud to mitigate the resource limitation issues of IoT and scalability bottlenecks of the cloud. Classical machine learning algorithms have been extensively used for intrusion detection, although scalability, feature engineering efforts, and accuracy have hindered their penetration into the security market. These shortcomings could be mitigated using the deep learning approach as it has been successful in big data fields. Apart from eliminating the need to craft features manually, deep learning is resilient against morphing attacks with high detection accuracy. This article proposes an LSTM network for distributed cyber-attack detection in fog-to-things communication. We identify and analyze critical attacks and threats targeting IoT devices, especially attacks exploiting vulnerabilities of wireless communications. The conducted experiments on two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of deeper models over traditional machine learning models. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) & future challenges in cloud based environment	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043583913&doi=10.1109%2fICISIM.2017.8122180&partnerID=40&md5=f7a54fe8a3261e25adb2b3ae4280af66	Cloud computing is an attention grabbing service model as a result of it reduces investment as its prices are in guide corresponding to use and request. Due to economic and technical edges it offers, Cloud computing has recently obtained major acceptance. However, as a result of the conveyed nature of distributed computing situations, its significant asset total, wide client get to, conservative and customized sharing of assets change gatecrashers to utilize cloud for his or her benefit. Crucial applications are getting additional associated with the web for cost-effectiveness and quantifiable causes; however this leaves them receptive attack. Most systems these days don't seem to be designed in contact up subtle attacks; an attacker who is ready to compromise one machine usually gains the facility to require down the complete system. To fight intruders, variety of security solution for cloud situations executes Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Be that as it may, most IDS arrangements are wrong for cloud conditions, because of numerous issues.

A framework for improving network resilience using SDN and fog nodes	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040508755&doi=10.1109%2fRNDM.2017.8093036&partnerID=40&md5=2d9269091c666df93f8bd5e864de835a	The IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the primary reasons for the massive growth in the number of connected devices to the Internet, thus leading to an increased volume of traffic in the core network. Fog and edge computing are becoming a solution to handle IoT traffic by moving timesensitive processing to the edge of the network, while using the conventional cloud for historical analysis and long-term storage. Providing processing, storage, and network communication at the edge network are the aim of fog computing to reduce delay, network traffic, and decentralise computing. In this paper, we define a framework that realises fog computing that can be extended to install any service of choice. Our framework utilises fog nodes as an extension of the traditional switch to include processing, networking, and storage. The fog nodes act as local decision-making elements that interface with software-defined networking (SDN), to be able to push updates throughout the network. To test our framework, we develop an IP spoofing security application and ensure its correctness through multiple experiments. © 2017 IEEE.

It inherits some of the characteristics from cloud computing but FC also have some distinguished features such as geo-distribution, location awareness and low latency. Along with the inherited characteristics, it also inherits the issues and problems of cloud computing like energy efficiency, resource management and security issues. This paper presents the critical analysis of the fog architecture with respect to security. The state of the art work done since 2012 is critical analyzed on the bases of security techniques and security threats. We grouped the existing security techniques on the bases of security goals achieved by each.

Identification of malicious edge devices in fog computing environments	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85024497418&doi=10.1080%2f19393555.2017.1334843&partnerID=40&md5=a2beafe743bf86139edf1e7956cca5a4	Device security is one of the major challenges for successful implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and fog computing. Researchers and IT organizations have explored many solutions to protect systems from unauthenticated device attacks (known as outside device attacks). Fog computing uses many edge devices (e.g., router, switch, and hub) for latency-aware processing of collected data. So, identification of malicious edge devices is one of the critical activities in data security of fog computing. Preventing attacks from malicious edge devices is more difficult because they have certain granted privileges to store and process the data. In this article, a proposed framework uses three technologies, a Markov model, an intrusion detection system (IDS), and a virtual honeypot device (VHD) to identify malicious edge devices in a fog computing environment. A two-stage Markov model is used to categorize edge devices effectively into four different levels. The VHD is designed to store and maintain a log repository of all identified malicious devices, which assists the system to defend itself from any unknown attacks in the future. The proposed model is tested in a simulated environment, and results indicate the effectiveness of the system. The proposed model is successful in identifying the malicious device as well as reducing the false IDS alarm rate. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A privacy-preserving framework for collaborative intrusion detection networks through fog computing	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034225563&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-69471-9_20&partnerID=40&md5=a0239820675445dbc129d49307a2e652	Nowadays, cyber threats (e.g., intrusions) are distributed across various networks with the dispersed networking resources. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have already become an essential solution to defend against a large amount of attacks. With the development of cloud computing, a modern IDS is able to implement more complicated detection algorithms by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud (i.e., utilizing computing resources from the cloud). However, during the detection process, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others for privacy concerns, even to the cloud side. For this sake, privacy-preserving technology has been applied to IDSs, while it still lacks of proper solutions for a collaborative intrusion detection network (CIDN) due to geographical distribution. A CIDN enables a set of dispersed IDS nodes to exchange required information. With the advent of fog computing, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving framework for collaborative networks based on fog devices. Our study shows that the proposed framework can help reduce the workload on cloud’s side. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

A fog computing based system for selective forwarding detection in mobile wireless sensor networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011049511&doi=10.1109%2fFAS-W.2016.60&partnerID=40&md5=e28c15bb81fb42a8698a45911bd6057e	Intrusions detection is one of the major issues that worry organizations in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Many researchers have dealt with this problem and have proposed many methods for detecting different kinds of intrusions such as selective forwarding, which is a serious attack that may obstruct communications in WSNs. However, as the applications of mobile computing, vehicular networks, and internet of things (IoT) are spreading immensely, selective forwarding detection in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) has become a key demand. This paper introduces the problem of selective forwarding in MWSNs, and discusses how available techniques for mitigation this problem in WSNs are not applicable in handling the problem in MWSNs due to sensors mobility. Therefore, the paper proposes a model that provides a global monitoring capability for tracing moving sensors and detecting malicious ones. The model leverages the infrastructure of Fog Computing to achieve this purpose. Furthermore, the paper provides a complete algorithm, a comprehensive discussion and experiments that show the correctness and importance of the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.

The integration of IoT with Cloud and Fog Computing can bring not only the required computational power and storage capacity, but they enable IoT services to be pervasive, cost-effective, and can be accessed from anywhere using any device (mobile or stationary). However, IoT infrastructures and services will introduce grand security challenges due to the significant increase in the attack surface, complexity, heterogeneity and number of resources. In this paper, we present an IoT security framework for smart infrastructures such as Smart Homes (SH) and smart buildings (SB). We also present a general threat model that can be used to develop a security protection methodology for IoT services against cyber-Attacks (known or unknown).

Anomaly behavior analysis for building automation systems	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021938367&doi=10.1109%2fAICCSA.2016.7945692&partnerID=40&md5=e34c4e4b58d1fa6687c2f3ac373e27cd	Advanced networking technology and increasing information services have led to extensive interconnection between Building Automation Systems (BAS) communication protocols and Internet, which makes Fog computing service a potential solution for automation of building end devices. However, the connection to Internet and public networks increases significantly the risk of the BAS networks being attacked due mainly to the significant increase in the attack surface. In this paper, we present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that combines context awareness and Cyber DNA techniques to detect network misbehavior from security and functionality perspectives. We developed runtime models for service interactions and functionality patterns by modeling the information that is continuously acquired from building assets into two novel data structures: Protocol Context Aware and sensor-DNA. Our IDS uses Anomaly Behavior Analysis techniques to accurately detect anomalous events triggered by cyber-attacks or any failure. A classification of detected attacks allow our IDS to automatically launch protective countermeasures. We evaluate our approach in the Smart Building testbed developed at the University of Arizona Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing, by launching several cyber-attacks that exploit the generic vulnerabilities of BAS. © 2016 IEEE.

New approaches to mitigation of malicious traffic in VoIP networks	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84864555324&partnerID=40&md5=a28b83539380eb9530a44287172c2e31	Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony is becoming widespread in use, and is often integrated into computer networks. Because of this, malicious software threatens VoIP systems in the same way that traditional computer systems have been attacked by viruses, worms, and other automated agents. VoIP networks are a challenge to secure against such malware as much of the network intelligence is focused on the edge devices and access environment. This paper describes the design and implementation of a novel VoIP security architecture in which evaluation of, and mitigation against, malicious traffic is demonstrated by the use of virtual machines to emulate vulnerable clients and servers through the use of apparent attack vectors. This new architecture, which is part of an ongoing research project, establishes interaction between the VoIP backend and the end users, thus providing information about ongoing and unknown attacks to users.

Published research has introduced the concept of the trustworthiness (reputation) of a single sensor node. Reputation is evaluated using an information-theoretic concept, the Kullback- Leibler (KL) distance. Reputation is added to the set of security features. In data aggregation, an opinion, a metric of the degree of belief, is generated to represent the uncertainty in the aggregation result. As aggregate information is disseminated along routes to the sink node(s), its corresponding opinion is propagated and regulated by Josang's belief model. By applying subjective logic on the opinion to manage trust propagation, the uncertainty inherent in aggregation results can be quantified for use in decision making. The concepts of reputation and opinion are modified to allow their application to a class of dynamic WSNs. Using reputation as a factor in determining interim aggregate information is equivalent to implementation of a reputation-based security filter at each processing stage of data fusion, thereby improving the intrusion detection and identification results based on unsupervised techniques. In particular, the reputation-based version of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) learns the signature of normal network traffic with the random probability weights normally used in the PNN replaced by the trust-based quantified reputations of sensor data or subsequent aggregation results generated by the sequential implementation of a version of Josang's belief model. A two-stage, intrusion detection and identification algorithm is implemented to overcome the problems of large sensor data loads and resource restrictions in WSNs. Performance of the twostage algorithm is assessed in simulations of WSN scenarios with multiple sensors at edge nodes for known intrusion attacks. Simulation results show improved robustness of the two-stage design based on reputation-based NNs to intrusion anomalies from compromised nodes and external intrusion attacks. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Securing IMS against novel threats	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-66749192137&doi=10.1002%2fbltj.20365&partnerID=40&md5=8c90e4ced8c286465d58eb131ffca2a4	Fixed mobile convergence (FMC) based on the 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is considered one of the most important communication technologies of this decade. Yet this all-IP-based network technology brings about the growing danger of security vulnerabilities in communication and data services. Protecting IMS infrastructure servers against malicious exploits poses a major challenge due to the huge number of systems that may be affected. We approach this problem by proposing an architecture for an autonomous and self-sufficient monitoring and protection system for devices and infrastructure inspired by network intrusion detection techniques. The crucial feature of our system is a signature-less detection of abnormal events and zero-day attacks. These attacks may be hidden in a single message or spread across a sequence of messages. Anomalies identified at any of the network domain's ingresses can be further analyzed for discriminative patterns that can be immediately distributed to all edge nodes in the network domain. © 2009 Alcatel-Lucent.

A resource efficient content inspection system for next generation smart NICs	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-62349135497&doi=10.1109%2fICCD.2008.4751855&partnerID=40&md5=d402c95a25a706c9bbeed60a38f73665	The aggregate power consumption of the Internet is increasing at an alarming rate, due in part to the rapid increase in the number of connected edge devices such as desktop PCs. Despite being left idle 75% of the time, 90% of PCs have their power management features disabled. Consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of Internet edge devices. One such method for reducing PC power consumption is by augmenting the Network Interface Card (NIC) with enhanced processing capabilities. These capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the PC to transition to a low-power sleep state while the NIC responds to network traffic on behalf of the PC - a technique known as power proxying. However, such a Smart-NIC (SNIC) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. In this paper, we present a NIC-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection. We use a novel partitioned TCAM technique that results in 87% energy savings and a 62% lower energy-delay product than existing non-partitioned router-based techniques, thus making our technique highly suitable for SNIC-based deployment. © 2008 IEEE.

Eclipse attacks on overlay networks: Threats and defenses	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34547492967&doi=10.1109%2fINFOCOM.2006.231&partnerID=40&md5=e846961782442f99e0a73a0273bcd8b6	"Overlay networks are widely used to deploy functionality at edge nodes without changing network routers. Each node in an overlay network maintains connections with a number of peers, forming a graph upon which a distributed application or service is implemented. In an ""Eclipse"" attack, a set of malicious, colluding overlay nodes arranges for a correct node to peer only with members of the coalition. If successful, the attacker can mediate most or all communication to and from the victim. Furthermore, by supplying biased neighbor information during normal overlay maintenance, a modest number of malicious nodes can eclipse a large number of correct victim nodes. This paper studies the impact of Eclipse attacks on structured overlays and shows the limitations of known defenses. We then present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new defense, in which nodes anonymously audit each other's connectivity. The key observation is that a node that mounts an Eclipse attack must have a higher than average node degree. We show that enforcing a node degree limit by auditing is an effective defense against Eclipse attacks. Furthermore, unlike most existing defenses, our defense leaves flexibility in the selection of neighboring nodes, thus permitting important overlay optimizations like proximity neighbor selection (PNS). © 2006 IEEE."

Development of an integrated solution for intrusion detection: A model based on data correlation	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-43449125891&doi=10.1109%2fICNS.2006.39&partnerID=40&md5=db4328969738e590fdeeaf7deaef5aec	This work describes a solution for intrusion detection that presents an improved operational efficacy - both in terms of performance as well as volume of processed data - reducing at the same time the number of false negative and false positive results. For that purpose we correlate the data collected by the intrusion detection system with other data sources, such as events that are reported by interfacing equipment (edge devices) as well as other agents considered crucial for this purpose such as vulnerability detection solutions. As part of the proposed solution the data is collected in a Relational Data base System, to facilitate data correlation, as well as making it available through an easy to use web interface. Additionally, the system interacts with the network managers, in response to pre-defined triggers using a unified messaging platform that uses tools capable of processing E-Mails, Text Messages and also an instant messaging tool based of the XMPP protocol. © 2006 IEEE.
