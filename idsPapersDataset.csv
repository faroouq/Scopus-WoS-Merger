mobile edge computing, fog et al.: a survey and analysis of security threats and challenges	 	for various reasons, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet certain requirements (e.g. low latency and jitter, context awareness, mobility support) that are crucial for several applications (e.g. vehicular networks, augmented reality). to fulfill these requirements, various paradigms, such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and mobile cloud computing, have emerged in recent years. while these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalized; no synergies have been explored. this is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others. the main goal of this study is to holistically analyze the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration. in our results, we will show that all edge paradigms should consider the advances in other paradigms.

a comprehensive study of security of internet-of-things	 	internet of things (iot), also referred to as the internet of objects, is envisioned as a transformative approach for providing numerous services. compact smart devices constitute an essential part of iot. they range widely in use, size, energy capacity, and computation power. however, the integration of these smart things into the standard internet introduces several security challenges because the majority of internet technologies and communication protocols were not designed to support iot. moreover, commercialization of iot has led to public security concerns, including personal privacy issues, threat of cyber attacks, and organized crime. in order to provide a guideline for those who want to investigate iot security and contribute to its improvement, this survey attempts to provide a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities and countermeasures against them on the edge-side layer of iot, which consists of three levels: (i) edge nodes, (ii) communication, and (iii) edge computing. to achieve this goal, we first briefly describe three widely-known iot reference models and define security in the context of iot. second, we discuss the possible applications of iot and potential motivations of the attackers who target this new paradigm. third, we discuss different attacks and threats. fourth, we describe possible countermeasures against these attacks. finally, we introduce two emerging security challenges not yet explained in detail in previous literature.	availability; confidentiality; countermeasures; integrity; internet of things; privacy; security; vulnerabilities	intrusion detection; attacks; systems; design; iot
a survey on emerging sdn and nfv security mechanisms for iot systems	 	the explosive rise of internet of things (iot) systems have notably increased the potential attack surfaces for cybercriminals. accounting for the features and constraints of iot devices, traditional security countermeasures can be inefficient in dynamic iot environments. in this vein, the advantages introduced by software defined networking (sdn) and network function virtualization (nfv) have the potential to reshape the landscape of cybersecurity for iot systems. to this aim, we provide a comprehensive analysis of security features introduced by nfv and sdn, describing the manifold strategies able to monitor, protect, and react to iot security threats. we also present lessons learned in the adoption of sdn/nfv-based protection approaches in iot environments, comparing them with conventional security countermeasures. finally, we deeply discuss the open challenges related to emerging sdn- and nfv-based security mechanisms, aiming to provide promising directives to conduct future research in this fervent area.	internet of things; security; sdn; nfv; cloud; edge computing	wireless sensor networks; software-defined networking; of-the-art; cyber security; intrusion detection; physical attacks; internet; things; service; architecture
a cybersecurity framework to identify malicious edge device in fog computing and cloud-of-things environments	 	device security is one of the major challenges for successful implementation of internet of things and fog computing environment in current it space. researchers and information technology (it) organizations have explored many solutions to protect systems from unauthenticated device attacks (known as outside device attacks). fog computing uses network devices (e.g. router, switch and hub) for latency-aware processing of collected data using iot. then, identification of malicious edge device is one of the critical activities in data security of fog computing environment. preventing attacks from malicious edge devices in fog computing environment is more difficult because they have certain granted privileges to use and process the data. in this paper, proposed cybersecurity framework uses three technologies which are markov model, intrusion detection system (ids) and virtual honeypot device (vhd) to identify malicious edge device in fog computing environment. a two stage hidden markov model is used to effectively categorize edge devices in four different levels. vhd is designed to store and maintain log repository of all identified malicious devices which assists the system to defend itself from any unknown attacks in the future. proposed cybersecurity framework is tested with real attacks in virtual environment created using openstack and microsoft azure. results indicated that proposed cybersecurity framework is successful in identifying the malicious device as well as reducing the false ids alarm rate.

fair resource allocation in an intrusion-detection system for edge computing ensuring the security of internet of things devices	 	the recent trend of edge computing extends cloud computing and the internet of things (iot) to the edge of the network. similar to most systems, an intrusion-detection system (ids) is commonly used to mitigate cybersecurity threats in edge computing. due to the limitations in edge nodes (e.g., in terms of computational and storage capabilities), efficient and fair resource allocation within an ids is challenging. this article studies ids architecture and resource allocation in edge computing. specifically, the proposed system is designed to facilitate multiple resources sharing and heterogeneous resource-demanding allocation. a general edge computing ids architecture is presented, and we use this as the basis for our model for allocating resources. then, a single-layer dominant and max-min fair (sdmmf) allocation is used, which has been theoretically proven to satisfy all hierarchical resource allocation properties, and a multilayer resource allocation scheme [in our system, the multilayer dominant and max-min fair (mdmmf) allocation] is used to cope with the multiple resources fair allocation in multiple layers.

iot security framework for smart cyber infrastructures	 	the internet of things (iot) will connect not only computers and mobile devices, but it will also interconnect smart buildings, homes, and cities, as well as electrical grids, gas, and water networks, automobiles, airplanes, etc. iot will lead to the development of a wide range of advanced information services that need to be processed in real-time and require data centers with large storage and computing power. the integration of iot with cloud and fog computing can bring not only the required computational power and storage capacity, but they enable iot services to be pervasive, cost-effective, and can be accessed from anywhere using any device (mobile or stationary). however, iot infrastructures and services will introduce grand security challenges due to the significant increase in the attack surface, complexity, heterogeneity and number of resources. in this paper, we present an iot security framework for smart infrastructures such as smart homes (sh) and smart buildings (sb). we also present a general threat model that can be used to develop a security protection methodology for iot services against cyber-attacks (known or unknown). additionally, we show that anomaly behavior analysis (aba) intrusion detection system (aba-ids) can detect and classify a wide range of attacks against iot sensors.	internet of things; threat model; attack vector; cyber security; smart infrastructures; fog computing	
the security of big data in fog-enabled iot applications including blockchain: a survey	 	the proliferation of inter-connected devices in critical industries, such as healthcare and power grid, is changing the perception of what constitutes critical infrastructure. the rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the internet of things (iot) grows. critical industries are essential to the foundation of today's society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. in today's hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. as the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. this new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. this paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. after introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. in addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled iot systems is presented. then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled iot are given. we also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in iot and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. in this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based iot systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations.	security; big data; internet of things; fog computing; edge computing; blockchain	fully homomorphic encryption; routing protocol; things security; network architecture; query authentication; intrusion detection; low-power; internet; privacy; challenges
edge computing-based security framework for big data analytics in vanets	 	with the exponential growth of technologies such as lot, edge computing, and 5g, a tremendous amount of structured and unstructured data is being generated from different applications in the smart citiy environment in recent years. thus, there is a need to develop sophisticated techniques that can efficiently process such huge volumes of data. one of the important components of smart cities, its, has led to many applications, including surveillance, infotainment, real-time traffic monitoring, and so on. however, its security, performance, and availability are major concerns facing the research community. the existing solutions, such as cellular networks, rsus, and mobile cloud computing, are far from perfect because these are highly dependent on centralized architecture and bear the cost of additional infrastructure deployment also, the conventional methods of data processing are not capable of handling dynamic and scalable data efficiently. to mitigate these issues, this article proposes an advanced vehicular communication technique where rsus are proposed to be replaced by edge computing platforms. then secure v2v and v2e communication is designed using the quotient filter, a probabilistic data structure. in summary, a smart security framework for vanets equipped with edge computing nodes and 5g technology has been designed to enhance the capabilities of communication and computation in the modern smart city environment. it has been experimentally demonstrated that use of edge nodes as an intermediate interface between vehicle and cloud reduces access latency and avoids congestion in the backbone network, which allows quick decisions to be made based on the traffic scenario in the geographical location of the vehicles. the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional vehicular models by providing an energy-efficient secure system with minimum delay.		intrusion detection; environment
a survey on security and privacy of 5g technologies: potential solutions, recent advancements, and future directions	 	security has become the primary concern in many telecommunications industries today as risks can have high consequences. especially, as the core and enable technologies will be associated with 5g network, the confidential information will move at all layers in future wireless systems. several incidents revealed that the hazard encountered by an infected wireless network, not only affects the security and privacy concerns, but also impedes the complex dynamics of the communications ecosystem. consequently, the complexity and strength of security attacks have increased in the recent past making the detection or prevention of sabotage a global challenge. from the security and privacy perspectives, this paper presents a comprehensive detail on the core and enabling technologies, which are used to build the 5g security model; network softwarization security, phy (physical) layer security and 5g privacy concerns, among others. additionally, the paper includes discussion on security monitoring and management of 5g networks. this paper also evaluates the related security measures and standards of core 5g technologies by resorting to different standardization bodies and provide a brief overview of 5g standardization security forces. furthermore, the key projects of international significance, in line with the security concerns of 5g and beyond are also presented. finally, a future directions and open challenges section has included to encourage future research.	multi-access edge computing (mec); network function virtualization (nfv); network security; network slicing; physical layer security (pls); privacy; software-defined networking (sdn) and telecommunication; 5g	physical-layer security; software defined networks; nonorthogonal multiple-access; massive mimo systems; resource-allocation; next-generation; health-care; intrusion detection; wireless networks; anomaly detection
sample selected extreme learning machine based intrusion detection in fog computing and mec	 	fog computing, as a new paradigm, has many characteristics that are different from cloud computing. due to the resources being limited, fog nodes/mec hosts are vulnerable to cyberattacks. lightweight intrusion detection system (ids) is a key technique to solve the problem. because extreme learning machine (elm) has the characteristics of fast training speed and good generalization ability, we present a new lightweight ids called sample selected extreme learning machine (ss-elm). the reason why we propose sample selected extreme learning machine is that fog nodes/mec hosts do not have the ability to store extremely large amounts of training data sets. accordingly, they are stored, computed, and sampled by the cloud servers. then, the selected sample is given to the fog nodes/mec hosts for training. this design can bring down the training time and increase the detection accuracy. experimental simulation verifies that ss-elm performs well in intrusion detection in terms of accuracy, training time, and the receiver operating characteristic (roc) value.		security
providing secure and reliable communication for next generation networks in smart cities	 	finding a framework that provides continuous, reliable, secure and sustainable diversified smart city services proves to be challenging in today's traditional cloud centralized solutions. this article envisions a mobile edge computing (mec) solution that enables node collaboration among iot devices to provide reliable and secure communication between devices and the fog layer on one hand, and the fog layer and the cloud layer on the other hand. the solution assumes that collaboration is determined based on nodes' resource capabilities and cooperation willingness. resource capabilities are defined using ontologies, while willingness to cooperate is described using a three-factor node criteria, namely: nature, attitude and awareness. a learning method is adopted to identify candidates for the service composition and delivery process. we show that the system does not require extensive training for services to be delivered correct and accurate. the proposed solution reduces the amount of unnecessary traffic flow to and from the edge, by relying on node-to-node communication protocols. communication to the fog and cloud layers is used for more data and computing-extensive applications, hence, ensuring secure communication protocols to the cloud. preliminary simulations are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of adapting the proposed framework to achieve smart city sustainability through service reliability and security. results show that the proposed solution outperforms other semi-cooperative and non-cooperative service composition techniques in terms of efficient service delivery and composition delay, service hit ratio, and suspicious node identification.	next generation networks; cloud; fog; sustainable smart city	service composition; intrusion detection; ensemble method; systems
multistage signaling game-based optimal detection strategies for suppressing malware diffusion in fog-cloud-based iot networks	 	we consider the internet of things (iot) with malware diffusion and seek optimal malware detection strategies for preserving the privacy of smart objects in iot networks and suppressing malware diffusion. to this end, we propose a malware detection infrastructure realized by an intrusion detection system (ids) with cloud and fog computing to overcome the ids deployment problem in smart objects due to their limited resources and heterogeneous subnetworks. we then employ a signaling game to disclose interactions between smart objects and the corresponding fog node because of malware uncertainty in smart objects. to minimize privacy leakage of smart objects, we also develop optimal strategies that maximize malware detection probability by theoretically computing the perfect bayesian equilibrium of the game. moreover, we analyze the factors influencing the optimal probability of a malicious smart object diffusing malware, and factors influencing the performance of a fog node in determining an infected smart object. finally, we present a framework to demonstrate a potential and practical application of suppressing malware diffusion in iot networks.	cloud computing; fog computing; internet of things (iot); malware; privacy; signaling game	intrusion detection; information diffusion; things security; internet; propagation; attacks; systems; service; issues; model
anomaly behavior analysis for iot sensors	 	the internet of things (iot) will not only connect computers and mobile devices but also interconnect smart buildings, homes, and cities, as well as electrical grids, gas, and water networks, automobiles, airplanes, etc. iot will lead to the development of a wide range of advanced information services that need to be processed in real time and require large storage and computational power. the integration of iot with fog and cloud computing not only brings the computational requirements but also enables iot services to be pervasive, cost-effective, and accessible from anywhere and at anytime. in any iot application, sensors are indispensable to bring the physical world into the digital world that can be implemented by leveraging fog computing. however, iot sensors will introduce major security challenges as they contribute to a significant increase in the iot attack surface. in this paper, we present a methodology to develop an intrusion detection system on the basis of anomaly behavior analysis to detect when a sensor has been compromised and used to provide misinformation. our preliminary experimental results show that our approach can accurately authenticate sensors on the basis of their behavior and can detect known and unknown sensor attacks with high detection rate and low false alarms.		internet
a new threat intelligence scheme for safeguarding industry 4.0 systems	 	industry 4.0 represents the fourth phase of industry and manufacturing revolution, unique in that it provides internet-connected smart systems, including automated factories, organizations, development on demand, and 'just-in-time' development. industry 4.0 includes the integration of cyber-physical systems (cpss), internet of things (iot), cloud and fog computing paradigms for developing smart systems, smart homes, and smart cities. given industry 4.0 is comprised sensor fields, actuators, fog and cloud processing paradigms, and network systems, designing a secure architecture faces two major challenges: handling heterogeneous sources at scale and maintaining security over a large, disparate, data-driven system that interacts with the physical environment. this paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new threat intelligence scheme that models the dynamic interactions of industry 4.0 components including physical and network systems. the scheme consists of two components: a smart management module and a threat intelligence module. the smart data management module handles heterogeneous data sources, one of the foundational requirements for interacting with an industry 4.0 system. this includes data to and from sensors, actuators, in addition to other forms of network traffic. the proposed threat intelligence technique is designed based on beta mixture-hidden markov models (mhmms) for discovering anomalous activities against both physical and network systems. the scheme is evaluated on two well-known datasets: the cps dataset of sensors and actuators and the unsw-nb15 dataset of network traffic. the results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms five peer mechanisms, suggesting its effectiveness as a viable deployment methodology in real-industry 4.0 systems.	industry 4.0; threat intelligence; cyber-attacks; cyber-physical systems (cps); internet of things (iot); cloud; fog; beta mixture-hidden markov models (mhmm)	big data analytics; intrusion detection; security; generation; prevention; algorithms; framework; internet
a fog computing based system for selective forwarding detection in mobile wireless sensor networks	 	intrusions detection is one of the major issues that worry organizations in wireless sensor networks (wsns). many researchers have dealt with this problem and have proposed many methods for detecting different kinds of intrusions such as selective forwarding, which is a serious attack that may obstruct communications in wsns. however, as the applications of mobile computing, vehicular networks, and internet of things (iot) are spreading immensely, selective forwarding detection in mobile wireless sensor networks (mwsns) has become a key demand. this paper introduces the problem of selective forwarding in mwsns, and discusses how available techniques for mitigation this problem in wsns are not applicable in handling the problem in mwsns due to sensors mobility. therefore, the paper proposes a model that provides a global monitoring capability for tracing moving sensors and detecting malicious ones. the model leverages the infrastructure of fog computing to achieve this purpose. furthermore, the paper provides a complete algorithm, a comprehensive discussion and experiments that show the correctness and importance of the proposed approach.	fog computing; intrusion detection; selective forwarding; mobile wireless sensor networks; information security	
a lightweight perceptron-based intrusion detection system for fog computing	 	fog computing is a paradigm that extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network in order to address the inherent problems of the cloud, such as latency and lack of mobility support and location-awareness. the fog is a decentralized platform capable of operating and processing data locally and can be installed in heterogeneous hardware which makes it ideal for internet of things (iot) applications. intrusion detection systems (idss) are an integral part of any security system for fog and iot networks to ensure the quality of service. due to the resource limitations of fog and iot devices, lightweight ids is highly desirable. in this paper, we present a lightweight ids based on a vector space representation using a multilayer perceptron (mlp) model. we evaluated the presented ids against the australian defense force academy linux dataset (adfa-ld) and australian defense force academy windows dataset (adfa-wd), which are new generation system calls datasets that contain exploits and attacks on various applications. the simulation shows that by using a single hidden layer and a small number of nodes, we are able to achieve a 94% accuracy, 95% recall, and 92% f1-measure in adfa-ld and 74% accuracy, 74% recall, and 74% f1-measure in adfa-wd. the performance is evaluated using a raspberry pi.	fog computing; intrusion detection; iot security; multilayer perceptron	anomaly detection; security; communication; internet
design of cognitive fog computing for intrusion detection in internet of things	 	internet of things (iot) is penetrating into every aspect of our lives including our body, our home and our living environment along with numerous security challenges. with rapidly growing number of connected devices in iot, the scope for cyber-attack also increases exponentially. therefore an effective intrusion detection system (ids) is needed to efficiently detect the attack at faster rate in highly scalable and dynamic iot environment. in this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique is proposed based on fog computing using online sequential extreme learning machine (os-elm) which can intelligently interpret the attacks from the iot traffic. in the proposed system, the existing centralized cloud intelligence in detecting the attack is distributed to local fog nodes to detect the attack at faster rate for iot application. the distributed architecture of fog computing enables distributed intrusion detection mechanism with scalability, flexibility and interoperability. the analysis of the proposed system proves to be efficient in terms of response time and detection accuracy.	extreme learning machine; fog computing; internet of things (iot); intrusion detection system	security; privacy; machine
outlier dirichlet mixture mechanism: adversarial statistical learning for anomaly detection in the fog	 	current anomaly detection systems (adss) apply statistical and machine learning algorithms to discover zero-day attacks, but such algorithms are vulnerable to advanced persistent threat actors. in this paper, we propose an adversarial statistical learning mechanism for anomaly detection, outlier dirichlet mixture-based ads (odm-ads), which has three new capabilities. first, it can self-adapt against data poisoning attacks that inject malicious instances in the training phase for disrupting the learning process. second, it establishes a statistical legitimate profile and considers variations from the baseline of the profile as anomalies using a proposed outlier function. third, to deal with dynamic and large-scale networks such as internet of things and cloud and fog computing, we suggest a framework for deploying the mechanism as software as a service in the fog nodes. the fog enables the proposed mechanism to concurrently process streaming data at the edge of the network. the odm-ads mechanism is evaluated using both nsl-kdd and unsw-nb15 datasets, whose findings indicate that odm-ads outperforms seven other peer algorithms in terms of accuracy, detection rates, false positive rates, and computational time.	adversarial statistical/machine learning; outlier detection; dirichlet mixture model; anomaly detection; fog computing	intrusion detection system; cloud; security; prevention; attacks; models
a fog-based privacy-preserving approach for distributed signature-based intrusion detection	 	intrusion detection systems (idss) are the frontier of defense against transmissible cyber threats that spread across distributed systems. modern idss overcome the limitation of hardware processing power by offloading computation extensive operations such as signature matching to the cloud. moreover, in order to prevent the rapid spread of transmissible cyber threats, collaborative intrusion detection schemes are widely deployed to allow distributed ids nodes to exchange information with each other. however, no party wants to disclose their own data during the detection process, especially sensitive user data to others, even the cloud providers for privacy concerns. in this background, privacy-preserving technology has been researched in the field of intrusion detection, whereas a collaborative intrusion detection network (cidn) environment still lacks of appropriate solutions due to its geographical distribution. with the advent of fog computing, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving framework for signature based intrusion detection in a distributed network based on fog devices. the results in both simulated and real environments demonstrate that our proposed framework can help reserve the privacy of shared data, reduce the workload on the cloud side, and offer less detection delay as compared to similar approaches.

hypergraph clustering model-based association analysis of ddos attacks in fog computing intrusion detection system	 	the birth of fog computing has given rise to many security threats. distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks by intruders on fog nodes will cause system resources to be illegally appropriate. intrusion detection system (ids) is a powerful technology that can be used to resist ddos attacks. in our previous research, we have proposed a fog computing intrusion detection system (fc-ids) framework. in this paper, we mainly analyze and model the ddos attacks under the framework of fc-ids. we propose a hypergraph clustering model based on apriori algorithm. this model can effectively describe the association between fog nodes which are suffering from the threat of ddos. through simulation, we verify that the resource utilization rate of the system can be effectively promoted through the ddos association analysis.	ddos; fog computing; hypergraph theory; intrusion detection system; association analysis	internet; security
deep recurrent neural network for iot intrusion detection system	 	as a results of the large scale development of the internet of things (iot), cloud computing capabilities including networking, data storage, management, and analytics are brought very close to the edge of networks forming fog computing and enhancing transferring and processing of tremendous amount of data. as the internet becomes more deeply integrated into our business operations through iot platform, the desire for reliable and efficient connections increases as well. fog and cloud security is a topical issue associated with every data storage, managing or processing paradigm. attacks once occurred, have ineradicable and disastrous effects on the development of iot, fog, cloud computing. therefore, many security systems/models have been proposed and/or implemented for the sake of fog security. intrusion detection systems are one of the premier choices especially ones that designed using artificial intelligence. in our paper, we presented an artificially full-automated intrusion detection system for fog security against cyber-attacks. the proposed model uses multi-layered of recurrent neural networks designed to be implemented for fog computing security that is very close to the end-users and iot devices. we demonstrated our proposed model using a balanced version of the challenging dataset: nsl-kdd. the performance of our model was measured using a variety of typical metrics, and we add two additional metrics: mathew correlation and cohen's kappa coefficients for deeper insight. where the experimental results and simulations proved the stability and robustness of the proposed model in terms of a variety of performance metrics.	internet of things; intrusion detection; kalman filter; iot; recursive network	
a novel ad-hoc mobile edge cloud offering security services through intelligent resource-aware offloading	 	while the usage of smart devices is increasing, security attacks and malware affecting such terminals are briskly evolving as well. mobile security suites exist to defend devices against malware and other intrusions. however, they require extensive resources not continuously available on mobile terminals, hence affecting their relevance, efficiency and sustainability. in this paper, we address the aforementioned problem while taking into account the devices limited resources such as energy and cpu usage as well as the mobile connectivity and latency. in this context, we propose an ad-hoc mobile edge cloud that takes advantage of wi-fi direct as means of achieving connectivity, sharing resources, and integrating security services among nearby mobile devices. the proposed scheme embeds a multi-objective resource-aware optimization model and genetic-based solution that provide smart offloading decision based on dynamic profiling of contextual and statistical data from the ad-hoc mobile edge cloud devices. the carried experiments illustrate the relevance and efficiency of exchanging security services while maintaining their sustainability with or without the availability of internet connection. moreover, the results provide optimal offloading decision and distribution of security services while significantly reducing energy consumption, execution time, and number of selected computational nodes without sacrificing security.	cloud computing; mobile handsets; intrusion detection; performance evaluation; servers; ad hoc networks; smart offloading; resource-aware service offloading; ad-hoc mobile edge cloud; edge computing; cloud computing; mobile computing; sustainable security services; security-as-a-service; intrusion detection	genetic algorithm; platform; malware
rad-ei: a routing attack detection scheme for edge-based internet of things environment	 	internet of things (iot) offers various types of application services in different domains, such as smart infrastructure, health-care, critical infrastructure, and intelligent transportation system. the name edge computing signifies a corner or edge in a network at which traffic enters or exits from the network. in edge computing, the data analysis task happens very close to the iot smart sensors and devices. edge computing can also speed up the analysis process, which allows decision makers to take action within a short duration of time. however, edge-based iot environment has several security and privacy issues similar to those for the cloud-based iot environment. various types of attacks, such as replay, man-in-the middle, impersonation, password guessing, routing attack, and other denial of service attacks may be possible in edge-based iot environment. the routing attacker nodes have the capability to deviate and disrupt the normal flow of traffic. these malicious nodes do not send packets (messages) to the edge node and only send packets to its neighbor collaborator attacker nodes. therefore, in the presence of such kind of routing attack, edge node does not get the information or sometimes it gets the partial information. this further affects the overall performance of communication of edge-based iot environment. in the presence of such an attack, the throughput of the network decreases, end-to-end delay increases, packet delivery ratio decreases, and other parameters also get affected. consequently, it is important to provide solution for such kind of attack. in this paper, we design an intrusion detection scheme for the detection of routing attack in edge-based iot environment called as rad-ei. we simulate rad-ei using the widely used ns2 simulator to measure different network parameters. furthermore, we provide the security analysis of rad-ei to prove its resilience against routing attacks. rad-ei accomplishes around 95.0% detection rate and 1.23% false positive rate that are notably better than other related existing schemes. in addition, rad-ei is efficient in terms of computation and communication costs. as a result, rad-ei is a good match for some critical and sensitive applications, such as smart security and surveillance system.	edge computing; intrusion detection; iot; ns2; routing attack; security	user authentication scheme; wireless sensor networks; intrusion detection; anomaly detection; sinkhole attacks; security; iot; performance
adaptive machine learning-based alarm reduction via edge computing for distributed intrusion detection systems	 	to protect assets and resources from being hacked, intrusion detection systems are widely implemented in organizations around the world. however, false alarms are one challenging issue for such systems, which would significantly degrade the effectiveness of detection and greatly increase the burden of analysis. to solve this problem, building an intelligent false alarm filter using machine learning classifiers is considered as one promising solution, where an appropriate algorithm can be selected in an adaptive way in order to maintain the filtration accuracy. by means of cloud computing, the task of adaptive algorithm selection can be offloaded to the cloud, whereas it could cause communication delay and increase additional burden. in this work, motivated by the advent of edge computing, we propose a framework to improve the intelligent false alarm reduction for dids based on edge computing devices. our framework can provide energy efficiency as the data can be processed at the edge for shorter response time. the evaluation results demonstrate that our framework can help reduce the workload for the central server and the delay as compared to the similar studies.	distributed system; edge computing; intelligent false alarm filter; intrusion detection; machine learning	trust management; privacy; networks; attacks; secure
towards the transversal detection of ddos network attacks in 5g multi-tenant overlay networks	 	currently, there is no any effective security solution which can detect cyber-attacks against 5g networks where multitenancy and user mobility are some unique characteristics that impose significant challenges over such security solutions. this paper focuses on addressing a transversal detection system to be able to protect at the same time, infrastructures, tenants and 5g users in both edge and core network segments of the 5g multi-tenant infrastructures. a novel approach which significantly extends the capabilities of a commonly used ids, to accurately identify attacking nodes in a 5g network, regardless of multiple network traffic encapsulations, has been proposed in this paper. the proposed approach is suitable to be deployed in almost all 5g network segments including the mobile edge computing. both architectural design and data models are described in this contribution. empirical experiments have been carried out a realistic 5g multi-tenant infrastructures to intensively validate the design of the proposed approach regarding scalability and flexibility.

smart audio sensors in the internet of things edge for anomaly detection	 	everyday objects are becoming smart enough to directly connect to other nearby and remote objects and systems. these objects increasingly interact with machine learning applications that perform feature extraction and model inference in the cloud. however, this approach poses several challenges due to latency, privacy, and dependency on network connectivity between data producers and consumers. to alleviate these limitations, computation should be moved as much as possible towards the iot edge, that is on gateways, if not directly on data producers. in this paper, we propose a design framework for smart audio sensors able to record and pre-process raw audio streams, before wirelessly transmitting the computed audio features to a modular iot gateway. in this paper, an anomaly detection algorithm executed as a micro-service is capable of analyzing the received features, hence detecting audio anomalies in real-time. first, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we deployed a real smart environment showcase. more in detail, we adopted two different anomaly detection algorithms, namely elliptic envelope and isolation forest, that were purposely trained and deployed on an affordable iot gateway to detect anomalous sound events happening in an office environment. then, we numerically compared both the deployments, in terms of end-to-end latency and gateway cpu load, also deriving some ideal capacity bounds.	anomaly detection; digital signal processing; edge computing; embedded devices; internet of things; iot gateway; machine learning; novelty detection; open-source platforms; outlier detection	network intrusion detection; scale
a novel differential game model-based intrusion response strategy in fog computing	 	fog computing is an emerging network paradigm. due to its characteristics (e.g., geo-location and constrained resource), fog computing is subject to a broad range of security threats. intrusion detection system (ids) is an essential security technology to deal with the security threats in fog computing. we have introduced a fog computing ids (fc-ids) framework in our previous work. in this paper, we study the optimal intrusion response strategy in fog computing based on the fc-ids scheme proposed in our previous work. we postulate the intrusion process in fog computing and describe it with a mathematical model based on differential game theory. according to this model, the optimal response strategy is obtained corresponding to the optimal intrusion strategy. theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our security model can effectively stabilize the intrusion frequency of the invaders in fog computing.		
trustworthy and sustainable smart city services at the edge	 	the proliferation of smart city and internet of things (iot) applications has introduced numerous challenges related to network performance, reliability, and security. moreover, the distributed nature of the smart city and iot infrastructure hs led to issues in regards to service availability, reliability, sustainability and security. edge computing provides a decentralized computing and communication framework for different types of applications such as intelligent transportation systems, cognitive assistance, health and social services. edge computing helps in improving the performance of such applications and reduces the end-to-end latency incurred for such time-critical applications. in this article, we introduce a trustworthy smart city service delivery solution at the edge of the network. the solution uses a collaborative technique between distributed edge servers and privacy mediator nodes with the support of an intrusion detection system to enhance the availability, reliability and security of smart city applications. simulation results show a reduction in the delay per service request by 39.2% for highly dense environments, and up to 62.6% for lightly dense environments. moreover, the solution reduces the dropped service requests below 2% with high accuracy and detection rates and low false-negative rates.	smart city; availability; reliability; sustainability; security; edge computing; internet of things	cities; challenges; security; model; iot
a fog computing based approach to ddos mitigation in iiot systems	 	distributed denial of service (ddos) cyber-attack poses a severe threat to the industrial internet of things (iiot) operation due to the security vulnerabilities resulted from increased connectivity and openness, and the large number of deployed low computation power devices. this paper applies fog computing concept in ddos mitigation by allocating traffic monitoring and analysis work close to local devices, and, on the other hand, coordinating and consolidating work to cloud central servers so as to achieve fast response while at low false alarm rate. the mitigation scheme consists of real-time traffic filtering via field firewall devices, which are able to reversely filter the signature botnet attack packets; offline specification based traffic analysis via virtualized network functions (vnfs) in the local servers; and centralized coordination via cloud server, which consolidates and correlates the information from the distributed local servers to make a more accurate decision. the proposed scheme is tested in an industrial control system testbed and the experiments evaluate the detection time and rate for two types of ddos attacks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.

privacy-preserving vehicular rogue node detection scheme for fog computing	 	in the last few decades, urban areas across the world have experienced rapid growth in transportation technology with a subsequent increase in transport-related challenges. these challenges have increased our need to employ technology for creating more intelligent solutions. one of the essential tools used to address challenges in traffic is providing vehicles with information about traffic conditions in nearby areas. vehicle ad-hoc networks (vanets) allow vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (v2i) communication with the aim of providing safe and efficient transportation. since drivers might make life-critical decisions based on information provided by other vehicles, dealing with rogue vehicles that send invalid data or breach users' privacy is an essential security issue in vanets. this paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving vehicular rogue node detection scheme using fog computing. the proposed scheme improves vehicle privacy, communication between vehicles, and computation efficiency by avoiding the exchange of traffic data between vehicles, allowing communication only through roadside units (rsus). this scheme also proposes an rsu authentication mechanism, along with a mechanism that would allow rsus to detect and eliminate vehicles providing false traffic data, which will improve the accuracy and efficiency of vanets. the proposed scheme is analyzed and evaluated using simulation, which presents significant improvements for data processing, accurately detecting rogue vehicles, minimizing overhead, and immunizing the system against colluding vehicles.	security; vanet; fog computing; rogue node detection; privacy preservation; authentication	intrusion detection; efficient; secure; internet
a secure multi-tier mobile edge computing model for data processing offloading based on degree of trust	 	current mobile devices need to run applications with high computational demands and critical response times. the mobile edge computing (mec) paradigm was developed to improve the performance of these devices. this new computation architecture allows for the mobile devices to execute applications on fog nodes at the network edge; this process is called data processing offloading. this article presents a security model for the externalization of application execution in multi-tier mec environments. the principal novelty of this study is that the model is able to modify the required security level in each tier of the distributed architecture as a function of the degree of trust associated with that tier. the basic idea is that a higher degree of trust requires a lower level of security, and vice versa. a formal framework is introduced that represents the general environment of application execution in distributed mec architectures. an architecture is proposed that allows for deployment of the model in production environments and is implemented for evaluation purposes. the results show that the security model can be applied in multi-tier mec architectures and that the model produces a minimal overhead, especially for computationally intensive applications.	mobile edge computing; security models; data processing offloading; multi-tier architectures	intrusion detection system; cloud; networks
intrusion detection system based on decision tree over big data in fog environment	 	fog computing, as the supplement of cloud computing, can provide low-latency services between mobile users and the cloud. however, fog devices may encounter security challenges as a result of the fog nodes being close to the end users and having limited computing ability. traditional network attacks may destroy the system of fog nodes. intrusion detection system (ids) is a proactive security protection technology and can be used in the fog environment. although ids in tradition network has been well investigated, unfortunately directly using them in the fog environment may be inappropriate. fog nodes produce massive amounts of data at all times, and, thus, enabling an ids system over big data in the fog environment is of paramount importance. in this study, we propose an ids system based on decision tree. firstly, we propose a preprocessing algorithmto digitize the strings in the given dataset and then normalize the whole data, to ensure the quality of the input data so as to improve the efficiency of detection. secondly, we use decision tree method for our ids system, and then we compare this method with naive bayesian method as well as knn method. both the 10% dataset and the full dataset are tested. our proposed method not only completely detects four kinds of attacks but also enables the detection of twenty-two kinds of attacks. the experimental results show that our ids system is effective and precise. above all, our ids system can be used in fog computing environment over big data.		
passban ids: an intelligent anomaly-based intrusion detection system for iot edge devices	 	cyber-threat protection is today's one of the most challenging research branches of information technology, while the exponentially increasing number of tiny, connected devices able to push personal data to the internet is doing nothing but exacerbating the battle between the involved parties. thus, this protection becomes crucial with a typical internet-of-things (iot) setup, as it usually involves several iot-based data sources interacting with the physical world within various application domains, such as agriculture, health care, home automation, critical industrial processes, etc. unfortunately, contemporary iot devices often offer very limited security features, laying themselves open to always new and more sophisticated attacks and also inhibiting the expected global adoption of iot technologies, not to mention millions of iot devices already deployed without any hardware security support. in this context, it is crucial to develop tools able to detect such cyber threats. in this article, we present passban, an intelligent intrusion detection system (ids) able to protect the iot devices that are directly connected to it. the peculiarity of the proposed solution is that it can be deployed directly on very cheap iot gateways (e.g., single-board pcs currently costing few tens of u.s. dollars), hence taking full advantage of the edge computing paradigm to detect cyber threats as close as possible to the corresponding data sources. we will demonstrate that passban is able to detect various types of malicious traffic, including port scanning, http and ssh brute force, and syn flood attacks with very low false positive rates and satisfactory accuracies.	internet of things; logic gates; intrusion detection; hardware; anomaly detection; anomaly detection; cybersecurity; edge computing; intrusion detection; intrusion detection system (ids); internet of things (iot); open source	internet; security; features
node state monitoring scheme in fog radio access networks for intrusion detection	 	this paper studies intrusion detection for fog computing in fog radio access networks (f-rans). as fog nodes are resource constrained, a traditional intrusion detection system (ids) cannot be directly deployed in f-rans due to the communication overhead and computational complexity. to address this challenge, we propose a skyline query-based scheme that can analyze the ids log statistics of fog nodes and provide a complete data processing flow. specifically, a three-step solution is proposed. first, a lightweight fog node filtering strategy is proposed to filter the raw data, which can reduce the fog-cloud communication overhead. second, a sliding-window-based mechanism is developed in the cloud server to efficiently process the asynchronous data flow. then, using the pre-processed data, a set of seriously attacked nodes will be identified by the skyline query. third, the security threat level of each individual fog node is calculated using the unascertained measure, which can determine the degree of security threat. the numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce communication overhead and computational complexity.	5g; fog computing; ids; skyline query; node monitoring; fnfs	architecture; internet; system; cloud

intrusion detection in edge-of-things computing	 	edge-of-things (eot) is a new evolving computing model driven by the internet of things (iot). it enables data processing, storage, and service to be shifted from the cloud to nearby edge devices/systems such as smartphones, routers, and base stations on the iot paradigm. however, this architectural shift causes the security and privacy issues to migrate to the different layers of the edge architecture. therefore, detecting intrusion in such a distributed environment is difficult. in this scenario, an intrusion detection systems is necessary. here, we propose an approach to quickly and accurately detect intrusive activities in the eot network, to realize the full potential of the iot. specifically, we propose a deep belief network (dbn) based on an advanced intrusion detection approach. we studied different detection models, by using different structures of dbns, and compared them with existing detection techniques. test results show that the proposed methodology performs essentially superior to the current state-of-the-art approaches.

identification of malicious edge devices in fog computing environments	 	device security is one of the major challenges for successful implementation of internet of things (iot) and fog computing. researchers and it organizations have explored many solutions to protect systems from unauthenticated device attacks (known as outside device attacks). fog computing uses many edge devices (e.g., router, switch, and hub) for latency-aware processing of collected data. so, identification of malicious edge devices is one of the critical activities in data security of fog computing. preventing attacks from malicious edge devices is more difficult because they have certain granted privileges to store and process the data. in this article, a proposed framework uses three technologies, a markov model, an intrusion detection system (ids), and a virtual honeypot device (vhd) to identify malicious edge devices in a fog computing environment. a two-stage markov model is used to categorize edge devices effectively into four different levels. the vhd is designed to store and maintain a log repository of all identified malicious devices, which assists the system to defend itself from any unknown attacks in the future. the proposed model is tested in a simulated environment, and results indicate the effectiveness of the system. the proposed model is successful in identifying the malicious device as well as reducing the false ids alarm rate.	edge device; fog computing; internet of things; intrusion detection system; two-stage markov model; virtual honeypot device	hidden markov-models; insider threat; intrusion detection; information-systems; security; cloud; networks; attacks; framework; issues

secure communication architecture for internet of things using smartphones and multi-access edge computing in environment monitoring	 	protecting the environment from many threats has become a priority worldwide. the internet of things technologies enables the continuous monitoring of various parameters related to environment statuses, such as air quality and many others. in this paper, we propose a security architecture based on cellular networks and multiple-access edge computing to collect sensors' information in real time. in the proposed architecture, users will interface the internet of things devices using their smartphones. the smartphones can interact with the cellular network and the internet of things devices at the same time. this unique ability is leveraged to provide strong authentication and confidentiality in accessing the internet of things devices. also in our architecture, we use gateways, as intermediate nodes that can interact with both the smartphones and the sensor nodes. therefore, our architecture includes a revocation mechanism for captured gateways. we propose an architecture for the internet of things devices along with protocols that can be used to establish security.	security; internet of things; multiple-access edge computing; environment monitoring	wireless sensor networks; ad hoc networks; intrusion detection; misuse detection; challenges; management; framework; system; wsn
a detection and prevention technique for man in the middle attack in fog computing	 	due to the large number of iot devices available, data needed to be processed by cloud service providers has grown exponentially. this leads to increase in the latency of cloud services and by extension latency in many iot applications. to reduce this latency, computing devices are installed at the edge of the network close to the user. these devices are called fog nodes. they allow the user to process some data without going all the way to the data center. while the data centers are equipped with abundant resources (i.e. processors, energy and memory), the fog devices are not. this means traditional techniques for preventing intrusion are not applicable at the fog level, because they will incur more latency and/or energy consumption. therefore, there is a need for low resource demanding, yet strong security system that will protect the fog layer from being attacked. this paper proposes an intrusion detection system (ids) and intrusion prevention system (ips) for man in the middle (mitm) attack at the fog layer. the ids consists of ids nodes that periodically interrogate nodes one hop away. the ips uses lightweight encryption to prevent man in the middle attack and its variants (i.e. eavesdropping, packet modification and wormhole attack).

glide: a game theory and data-driven mimicking linkage intrusion detection for edge computing networks	 	the real-time and high-continuity requirements of the edge computing network gain more and more attention because of its active defence problem, that is, a data-driven complex problem. due to the dual constraints of the hybrid feature of edge computing networks and the uncertainty of new attack features, implementing active defence measures such as detection, evasion, trap, and control is essential for the security protection of edge computing networks with high real-time and continuity requirements. the basic idea of safe active defence is to make the defence gain more significant than the attack loss. to encounter the new attacks with uncertain features introduced by the ubiquitous transmission network in the edge computing network, this paper investigates the attack behaviour and presents an attack-defence mechanism based on game theory. based on the idea of dynamic intrusion detection, we utilize the game theory in the field of edge computing network and suggest a data-driven mimicry intrusion detection game model-based technique called glide. the game income of participants and utility computing methods under different deployment strategies are analysed in detail. according to the proof analysis of the nash equilibrium condition in the model, the contradictory dynamic game relationship is described. therefore, the optimal deployment strategy of the multiredundancy edge computing terminal intrusion detection service in the edge computing network is obtained by solving the game balance point. the detection probability of the edge computing network for network attacks is improved, and the cost of intrusion detection of the edge computing network is reduced.		computation offloading method; internet; things; recommendation
sdnfv based threat monitoring and security framework for multi-access edge computing infrastructure	 	ddos botnet attacks such as advanced persistent & ransom dos assaults, botnets and application ddos flood attacks are examples of multi-vector, sophisticated application-layer attacks. conventional it security approaches are centralized and have limitations in terms of scale, network-wide monitoring and resources for distributed detection. this paper proposes a newer approach that integrates multi-layer cooperative security intelligence on to a converged software-defined-networking/network-function-virtualization architecture in typical multi-access edge computing (mec) scenario. the key features of framework include: a) distributed lightweight real-time ddos threat analytics and response framework (dtars), to identify ddos/botnets closer to the source of attacks b) behavioral monitoring and profiling functions in data plane and validation of control plane operations, c) advanced correlation, signature, and anomaly detection techniques, d) real-time threat analytics system e) scalable and agile mitigation mechanisms based on a stateful-data plane and security-aware sdn stack. we evaluate the performance of dtars framework within three practical mec case studies: sdn enabled mobile lte mec network, sdn enabled iot mec network and software-defined datacenter edge network. in comparison to legacy mec network, dtars incurs about 60% less overhead than the legacy lte and 40% lesser than a prior ovs sdn based mec-lte solution, detection speed that was about 10x faster, detection accuracy of about 96% at different attack intensities and improves the overall end-to-end connection management performance under rapid scaling of end users.	mec; lte; sdn; nfv; sdnfv; openflow; iot; cloud; edge networks; ddos; botnet; network security; threat analytics; security; network intrusion detection system; nids

impact: impersonation attack detection via edge computing using deep autoencoder and feature abstraction	 	an ever-increasing number of computing devices interconnected through wireless networks encapsulated in the cyber-physical-social systems and a significant amount of sensitive network data transmitted among them have raised security and privacy concerns. intrusion detection system (ids) is known as an effective defence mechanism and most recently machine learning (ml) methods are used for its development. however, internet of things (iot) devices often have limited computational resources such as limited energy source, computational power and memory, thus, traditional ml-based ids that require extensive computational resources are not suitable for running on such devices. this study thus is to design and develop a lightweight ml-based ids tailored for the resource-constrained devices. specifically, the study proposes a lightweight ml-based ids model namely impact (impersonation attack detection using deep auto-encoder and feature abstraction). this is based on deep feature learning with gradient-based linear support vector machine (svm) to deploy and run on resource-constrained devices by reducing the number of features through feature extraction and selection using a stacked autoencoder (sae), mutual information (mi) and c4.8 wrapper. the impact is trained on aegean wi-fi intrusion dataset (awid) to detect impersonation attack. numerical results show that the proposed impact achieved 98.22% accuracy with 97.64% detection rate and 1.20% false alarm rate and outperformed existing state-of-the-art benchmark models. another key contribution of this study is the investigation of the features in awid dataset for its usability for further development of ids.	iot security; intrusion detection; feature engineering; mutual information; machine learning; edge computing	intrusion-detection; internet
false data detection for fog and internet of things networks	 	the internet of things (iot) context brings new security issues due to billions of smart end-devices both interconnected in wireless networks and connected to the internet by using different technologies. in this paper, we propose an attack-detection method, named data intrusion detection system (dataids), based on real-time data analysis. as end devices are mainly resource constrained, fog computing (fc) is introduced to implement the dataids. fc increases storage, computation capabilities, and processing capabilities, allowing it to detect promptly an attack with respect to security solutions on the cloud. this paper also considers an attack tree to model threats and vulnerabilities of fog/iot scenarios with heterogeneous devices and suggests countermeasure costs. we verify the performance of the proposed dataids, implementing a testbed with several devices that measure different physical quantities and by using standard data-gathering protocols.	internet of things; security; dynamic protection; intelligence for embedded and cyber-physical systems; adaptive systems; fault detection and diagnosis; smart sensor networks	intrusion detection; security
review of the d2d trusted cooperative mechanism in mobile edge computing	 	mobile edge computing (mec) effectively integrates wireless network and internet technologies and adds computing, storage, and processing functions to the edge of cellular networks. this new network architecture model can deliver services directly from the cloud to the very edge of the network while providing the best efficiency in mobile networks. however, due to the dynamic, open, and collaborative nature of mec network environments, network security issues have become increasingly complex. devices cannot easily ensure obtaining satisfactory and safe services because of the numerous, dynamic, and collaborative character of mec devices and the lack of trust between devices. the trusted cooperative mechanism can help solve this problem. in this paper, we analyze the mec network structure and device-to-device (d2d) trusted cooperative mechanism and their challenging issues and then discuss and compare different ways to establish the d2d trusted cooperative relationship in mec, such as social trust, reputation, authentication techniques, and intrusion detection. all these ways focus on enhancing the efficiency, stability, and security of mec services in presenting trustworthy services.	mobile edge computing; trusted cooperative mechanism; d2d; social trust; reputation; authentication techniques	security; cloud; internet; things; architecture; migration; networks; privacy; scheme
anomaly behavior analysis for building automation systems	 	advanced networking technology and increasing information services have led to extensive interconnection between building automation systems (bas) communication protocols and internet, which makes fog computing service a potential solution for automation of building end devices. however, the connection to internet and public networks increases significantly the risk of the bas networks being attacked due mainly to the significant increase in the attack surface. in this paper, we present an anomaly based intrusion detection system (ids) that combines context awareness and cyber dna techniques to detect network misbehavior from security and functionality perspectives. we developed runtime models for service interactions and functionality patterns by modeling the information that is continuously acquired from building assets into two novel data structures: protocol context aware and sensor-dna. our ids uses anomaly behavior analysis techniques to accurately detect anomalous events triggered by cyber-attacks or any failure. a classification of detected attacks allow our ids to automatically launch protective countermeasures. we evaluate our approach in the smart building testbed developed at the university of arizona center for cloud and autonomic computing, by launching several cyber-attacks that exploit the generic vulnerabilities of bas.	fog computing; intrusion detection system; anomaly behavior analysis; building automation system; internet of things	
semisupervised-learning-based security to detect and mitigate intrusions in iot network	 	our world is moving toward an internet of things (iot) era by connecting billions of iot. there are several security loopholes in the iot network. intrusion can lead to performance degradation and pose a threat to data security. hence, there is a need for a method to detect intrusion in the iot networks. existing solutions use supervised-learning-based intrusion detection methods that need a huge labeled data set for better accuracy. it is not easy to source out a huge labeled data set because the size of the iot network is huge. to overcome some of the impediments in the existing solutions, we propose a novel sdrk machine learning (ml) algorithm to detect intrusion. sdrk leverages supervised deep neural networks (dnns) and unsupervised clustering techniques. the intrusion detection and mitigation algorithms are placed in the fog nodes that are between iot and cloud layers. we test our proposed methodology against the data deluge (dd) attack in the testbed. the sdrk model is tested on the benchmark nsl-kdd data set. we compare the results with state-of-the-art solutions. when testing with the nsl-kdd data set, we find that sdrk detects the attacks with improved accuracy of 99.78%.	security; internet of things; computer architecture; cloud computing; training; machine learning; switches; data deluge (dd) attack; fog computing; internet of things (iot); intrusion; security; semisupervised learning	attack detection; internet; communication; architectures; things
hybrid approach to intrusion detection in fog-based iot environments	 	in the internet of things (iot) systems, information of various kinds is continuously captured, processed, and transmitted by systems generally interconnected by the internet and distributed solutions. attacks to capture information and overload services are common. this fact makes security techniques indispensable in iot en-vironments. intrusion detection is one of the vital security points, aimed at identifying attempted attacks. the characteristics of iot devices make it impossible to apply these solutions in this environment. also, the existing anomaly-based methods for multiclass detection do not present acceptable accuracy. we present an intrusion detection architecture that operates in the fog computing layer. it has two steps and aims to classify events into specific types of attacks or non-attacks, for the execution of countermeasures. our work presents a relevant con-tribution to the state of the art in this aspect. we propose a hybrid binary classification method called dnn-knn. it has high accuracy and recall rates and is ideal for composing the first level of the two-stage detection method of the presented architecture. the approach is based on deep neural networks (dnn) and the k-nearest neighbor (knn) algorithm. it was evaluated with the public databases nsl-kdd and cicids2017. we used the method of selecting attributes based on the rate of information gain. the approach proposed in this work obtained 99.77% accuracy for the nsl-kdd dataset and 99.85% accuracy for the cicids2017 dataset. the experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid approach was able to achieve greater precision about classic machine learning approaches and the recent advances in intrusion detection for iot systems. in addition, the approach works with low overhead in terms of memory and processing costs.	internet of things; intrusion detection; fog computing; machine learning	deep learning approach; neural-network; internet; optimization; hypergraph; framework; ids
a distributed framework for detecting ddos attacks in smart contract-based blockchain-iot systems by leveraging fog computing	 	with the advancement of blockchain technology, and the proliferation of internet of things (iot)-driven devices, the blockchain-iot applications is changing the perception and working infrastructure of smart networks. blockchain supports decentralized architecture and provides secure management, authentication, and access to iot systems by deploying smart contracts provided by ethereum. the growing demand and expansion of blockchain-iot systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. moreover, distributed denial-of-service (ddos) attacks are the most challenging threats to smart contracts in blockchain-iot systems. the 2016 decentralized autonomous organization and 2017 parity wallet attacks exposed the critical fault-lines among ethereum smart contracts. currently, there is no security mechanism available for smart contracts after its deployment in blockchain-iot systems. in order to address these challenges, first we use two artificial intelligence techniques, random forest (rf) and xgboost that gives full autonomy in decision making capabilities in the proposed security framework. second, for data load balancing and distributed file storage of iot data, interplanetary file system is suggested. finally, we are the first to propose a distributed framework based on fog computing to detect ddos attacks in smart contracts. the performance of the detection system is evaluated using actual iot dataset, namely, bot-iot. the proposed system is evaluated in terms of accuracy (ac), detection rate (dr), and false alarm rate (far). the results confirms the superiority of the proposed framework over some of the recent state-of-art techniques in detecting rare attacks. the proposed framework has achieved dr up to 99.99% using rf by using 10 features of bot-iot dataset.		intrusion detection; mutual information; data analytics; internet; things; selection; sdn; environment; algorithm; security
intelligent secure ecosystem based on metaheuristic and functional link neural network for edge of things	 	internet of things (iot) has evolved for building smart environments in a distributed system, where the data produced by iot devices are transmitted through edge computing devices to streamline the flow of traffic from iot devices to a distributed network. in such a scenario, the attacker introduces many attacks to the edge before forwarding them to distributed servers. this necessitates intrusion detection systems for such environments to mitigate security attacks. this paper has projected a basis for characterization of intrusive behaviors in a distributed system based on the functional link neural nets response weighted-average and teaching-learning metaheuristic with elitism on weight-space. the proposed technique makes use of teaching-learning metaheuristic optimization to obtain suitable parameters for the functional link neural net. furthermore, the processing of duplicate parameters is successfully avoided by using mutation operation. in addition to this, in this paper the proposed method is found to be more efficient in terms of computational burden.	neural networks; optimization; intrusion detection; ecosystems; servers; image edge detection; edge computing; elitism; functional link artificial neural network (flann); internet of things (iot); intrusion detection system (ids); metaheuristic	intrusion-detection; optimization
a collaborative security framework for software-defined wireless sensor networks	 	with the advent of 5g, technologies such as software-defined networks (sdns) and network function virtualization (nfv) have been developed to facilitate simple programmable control of wireless sensor networks (wsns). however, wsns are typically deployed in potentially untrusted environments. therefore, it is imperative to address the security challenges before they can be implemented. in this paper, we propose a software-defined security framework that combines intrusion prevention in conjunction with a collaborative anomaly detection systems. initially, an ips-based authentication process is designed to provide a lightweight intrusion prevention scheme in the data plane. subsequently, a collaborative anomaly detection system is leveraged with the aim of supplying a cost-effective intrusion detection solution near the data plane. moreover, to correlate the true positive alerts raised by the sensor nodes in the network edge, a smart monitoring system (sms) is exploited in the control plane. the performance of the proposed model is evaluated under different security scenarios as well as compared with other methods, where the model's high security and reduction of false alarms are demonstrated.	wireless sensor networks; authentication; anomaly detection; collaboration; wireless communication; communication system security; intrusion prevention; intrusion detection; anomaly detection; collaborative security; fog computing; software-defined network	learning approach; significant-bit; authentication; prediction; integrity; scheme
cpss lr-ddos detection and defense in edge computing utilizing dcnn q-learning	 	existing intrusion detection and defense models for cpss (cyber-physical-social systems) are based on analyzing the static intrusion characteristics, which cannot effectively detect large-scale low-rate denial-of-service (lr-ddos) attacks, especially in the edge environment. in this paper, we firstly explore and enhance mirai botnet to a sophisticated multi-targets low-rate tcp attack network, which makes edge lr-ddos more powerful and obfuscates their activity. and then, we develop a novel intrusion detection and defense hybrid method for above cpss lr-ddos scenario in edge environment, which takes advantage of locality sensitive features extraction and deep convolution neural network (dcnn) to auto learn the optimal features of the original data distribution and employs deep reinforcement learning q-network as the powerful decision maker to defend attacks. the experimental results in detection phase prove the proposed method can distinguish abnormal network attack flows with higher detection accuracy and faster response time than kinds of support vector machines (svm), k-means and surface learning neural network etc. even more, it has a certain detection rate for unknown new attacks, which means the method is effective and suitable for the actual network environment. the experimental results in defense phase prove it can defense lr-ddos attacks smoothly.	image edge detection; computer crime; edge computing; machine learning; feature extraction; botnet; neural networks; deep convolution neural network; q learning; deep reinforcement learning; edge computing; lr-ddos; cpss	hashing-based approach; incentive mechanism; service recommendation
securing connection between it and ot: the fog intrusion detection system prospective	 	industrial control systems traditionally achieved security by using proprietary protocols to communicate in an isolated environment from the outside. this paradigm is changed with the advent of the industrial internet of things that foresees flexible and interconnected systems. in this contribution, a device acting as a connection between the operational technology network and information technology network is proposed. the device is an intrusion detection system related to legacy systems that is able to collect and reporting data to and from industrial iot devices. it is based on the common signature based intrusion detection system developed in the information technology domain, however, to cope with the constraints of the operation technology domain, it exploits anomaly based features. specifically, it is able to analyze the traffic on the network at application layer by mean of deep packet inspection, parsing the information carried by the proprietary protocols. at a later stage, it collect and aggregate data from and to iot domain. a simple set up is considered to prove the effectiveness of the approach.	cybersecurity; intrusion detection system; industrial internet of things; fog computing; new implementation approaches; industrial informatics	model
secure, resilient, and self-configuring fog architecture for untrustworthy iot environments	 	the extensive increase in the number of iot devices and the massive data generated and sent to the cloud hinder the cloud abilities to handle it. further, some iot devices are latency-sensitive. such sensitivity makes it harder for far clouds to handle the iot needs in a timely manner. a new technology named fog computing has emerged as a solution to such problems. fog computing relies on close by computational devices to handle the conventional cloud load. however, fog computing introduced additional problems related to the trustworthiness and safety of such devices. unfortunately, the suggested architectures did not consider such problem. in this paper we present a novel self-configuring fog architecture to support iot networks with security and trust in mind. we realize the concept of moving-target defense by mobilizing the applications inside the fog using live migrations. performance evaluations using a benchmark for mobilized applications showed that the added overhead of live migrations is very small making it deployable in real scenarios. finally, we presented a mathematical model to estimate the survival probabilities of both static and mobile applications within the fog. moreover, this work can be extended to other systems such as mobile ad-hoc networks (manets) or in vehicular cloud computing (vcc).	iot; ad-hoc cloud; intrusion detection; fog computing	things iot; internet; system
enhancing intelligent alarm reduction for distributed intrusion detection systems via edge computing	 	to construct an intelligent alarm filter is a promising solution to help reduce false alarms for an intrusion detection system (ids), in which an appropriate algorithm can be selected in an adaptive way. taking the advantage of cloud computing, the process of algorithm selection can be offloaded to the cloud, but it may cause communication delay and additional burden on the cloud side. this issue may become worse when it comes to distributed intrusion detection systems (didss), i.e., some iot applications might require very short response time and most of the end nodes in iot are energy constrained things. in this paper, with the advent of edge computing, we propose a framework for improving the intelligent false alarm reduction for didss based on edge computing devices (i.e., the data can be processed at the edge for shorter response time and could be more energy efficient). the evaluation shows that the proposed framework can help reduce the workload for the central server and shorten the delay as compared to the similar studies.	intrusion detection; intelligent false alarm filtration; edge computing; distributed environment; cloud computing	networks

caavi-rics model for observing the security of distributed iot and edge computing systems	 	the pervasive integration of 'things' in the internet of things together with state-of-the-art computer systems provide a stimulating environment for creativity and business opportunities, but also a large range of security challenges. engineering the security of such systems must acknowledge the peculiar conditions under which such systems operate: low computational capacity, distributed decision-making, significant node churn, etc. these conditions must, therefore, be supported by the techniques and methodologies for building secure and robust iot systems. with caavi-rics methodology we explore credibility, authentication, authorization, verification, and integrity of iot and edge computing systems, through explaining the rationale, influence, concerns, and security solutions that accompany them. our contribution is a complete and detailed systematic categorization and streamlining of security problems, covering the security environment of iot and edge computing systems. besides, we contribute to the debate on key aspects of edge computing security and state-of-the-art solutions.	edge computing; iot; cyber-security; distributed security	wireless sensor networks; key agreement scheme; efficient authentication; intrusion detection; access-control; internet; things; management
progressive researches on iot security: an exhaustive analysis from the perspective of protocols, vulnerabilities, and preemptive architectonics	 	the iot is the upcoming one of the major networking technologies. using the iot, different items or devices can be allowed to continuously generate, obtain, and exchange information. different iot applications nowadays are centered on computerizing various errands and are attempting to engage the inanimate physical items to act without direct supervision of a human. the current and forthcoming iot services are exceptionally encouraging to build the degree of solace, proficiency, and automation for the clients. to obtain the option to actualize such a world in a continuously developing manner requires high security, protection, verification, and recuperation from assaults. right now, incorporating the requisite changes in iot systems engineering to achieve end-to-end, stable iot infrastructure is paramount. in this research, a comprehensive analysis is incorporated into the security-relevant problems and threat wellsprings in iot resources or applications. specific that and current advancements based on maintaining a high degree of confidence in iot apps are addressed while looking at the security issues. four distinct developments are investigated, including cryptography, fog computing, edge computing, and ml (machine learning), to extend the degree of iot security.	iot; vulnerability; security; cryptography; fog computing; edge computing; machine learning	information security; prevention technique; intrusion detection; internet; things; framework; scheme; attack; communication; privacy
5g in the internet of things era: an overview on security and privacy challenges	 	now reaching 2020, the world is witnessing the initial diffusion of 5g networks, which promise to revolutionize the mobile wireless communications, providing faster services, very low delays, and a very pervasive connectivity via mobile devices. it is worth to remark that the main paradigm which will take advantage from 5g is really the internet of things (iot). however, the spreading of 5g technology also generates important concerns in terms of security and privacy, due to the continuous and wireless connection to the network, which hinders the reliability of the involved devices. this paper deeply analyzed the current state of the art about the existing security and privacy solutions tailored to 5g. more in detail, the following requirements are discussed: data integrity, confidentiality, authentication, access control, non-repudiation, trust, privacy, identity management, key management, policy enforcement, and intrusion detection. furthermore, the paper aims to shed the light on future research directions towards the realization of secure and privacy aware 5g systems. to this end, the role of emerging paradigms, such as iot, fog computing, and blockchain is investigated.	5g; internet of things; fog computing; blockchain; security; privacy	nonorthogonal multiple-access; intrusion detection system; wireless networks; next-generation; communication; blockchain; mobile; architecture; efficient; authentication
fuzzy logic and fog based secure architecture for internet of things (flfsiot)	 	motivated by the recent explosion of interest around the internet of things (iot), this paper is focused on the dynamics of its security. it is a fact that at present, there is a dearth of consolidated and methodical visions for assuring the security of iot. this owes to its unique characteristics like interdependence of iot devices and services, device heterogeneity, mobility, affinity to owners, pervasiveness, and unattended nature. the constraints of energy, memory, bandwidth and computability further complicate this picture. the strategies available in the literature today do not entirely consider this intricate nature of iot environments. moreover, uncertainty is not adequately acknowledged by the researchers while designing the security procedures for iot, even though most of the iot related security problems stem from an uncertain environment. this paper focuses on addressing this uncertainty, along with the other major security issues of iot. it gives detailed categorization of the attacks in iot. to this end, a fuzzy logic and fog based secure architecture for iot (flfsiot) has been proposed in this paper that works in real-time. in flfsiot, fuzzy logic has been used to alleviate the uncertainty of belonging to one crisp cluster of an edge node and for detecting various classical attacks. the fog supported iot architecture has been used to make flfsiot intrinsically more secure in comparison to the cloud-supported iot by omitting the latency and other issues. as such, this work feeds the benefits of fuzzy log and fog computing into the carving of a generic solution to the iot's security problem. the efficiency of flfsiot has been evaluated against the distributed denial of service (ddos) and collusion attacks, and it has been observed that it gives more accurate results than the existing benchmarks.	internet of things (iot); security; fog supported iot; fuzzy logic; distributed denial of service (ddos) attack; collusion attack; real-time attack detection; flfsiot	intrusion detection; attack; system
reinforcement learning empowered idps for vehicular networks in edge computing	 	as vanets have been widely applied in various fields including entertainment and safety- related applications like autonomous driving, malicious intrusions into vanets may lead to disastrous results. hence, intrusion detection accuracy as well as efficiency is sensitive to the normal operation of vanets. regarding this, in this article we propose an architecture of idps for vanets. one of the highlights of the architecture is that it applies rl throughout the architecture in order to deal with the dynamics of vanets and to make proper decisions according to current vanets states, aiming at high detection accuracy. on the other hand, the architecture is deployed in ec in an attempt to obtain low detection latency with high processing efficiency, since vanets idps is sensitive to latency, especially for safety applications. a case study is conducted to assess the validity of the proposed vanets idps in ec, with the results revealing that it holds the capacity to detect and prevent intrusion in vanets in complex environments.	vehicular ad hoc networks; task analysis; intrusion detection; monitoring; servers; computer architecture; safety	
sdn/nfv security framework for fog-to-things computing infrastructure	 	currently, core networking architectures are facing disruptive developments, due to emergence of paradigms such as software-defined-networking (sdn) for control, network function virtualization (nfv) for services, and so on. these are the key enabling technologies for future applications in 5g and locality-based internet of things (iot)/wireless sensor network services. the proliferation of iot devices at the edge networks is driving the growth of all-connected world of internet traffic. in the cloud-to-things continuum, processing of information and data at the edge mandates development of security best practices to arise within a fog computing environment. service providers are transforming their business using nfv-based services and sdn-enabled networks. the sdn paradigm offers an easily programmable model, global view, and control for modern networks, which demand faster response to security incidents and dynamically enforce countermeasures to intrusions and cyberattacks. this article proposes an autonomic multilayer security framework called distributed threat analytics and response system (dtars) for a converged architecture of fog/edge computing and sdn infrastructures, for emerging applications in iot and 5g networks. the major detection scheme is deployed within the data plane, consisting of a coarse-grained behavioral, anti-spoofing, flow monitoring and fine-grained traffic multi-feature entropy-based algorithms. we developed exemplary defense applications under dtars framework, on a malware testbed imitating the real-life ddos/botnets such as mirai. the experiments and analysis show that dtars is capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 95% under attack intensities up to 50 000 packets/s. the benign traffic forwarding rate remains unaffected with dtars, while it drops down to 65% with traditional nids for advanced ddos attacks. further, dtars achieves this performance without incurring additional latency due to data plane overhead.	cloud security; edge network; fog computing; internet of things (iot); network intrusion detection system (nids); nfv; openflow; sdn; 5g	ddos defense; plane
dynamic decision support for resource offloading in heterogeneous internet of things environments	 	computation offloading is one of the primary technological enablers of the internet of things (iot), as it helps address individual devices' resource restrictions. in the past, offloading would always utilise remote cloud infrastructures, but the increasing size of iot data traffic and the real-time response requirements of modern and future iot applications have led to the adoption of the edge computing paradigm, where the data is processed at the edge of the network. the decision as to whether cloud or edge resources will be utilised is typically taken at the design stage based on the type of the iot device. yet, the conditions that determine the optimality of this decision, such as the arrival rate, nature and sizes of the tasks, and crucially the real-time condition of the networks involved, keep changing. at the same time, the energy consumption of iot devices is usually a key requirement, which is affected primarily by the time it takes to complete tasks, whether for the actual computation or for offloading them through the network. here, we model the expected time and energy costs for the different options of offloading a task to the edge or the cloud, as well as of carrying out on the device itself. we use this model to allow the device to take the offloading decision dynamically as a new task arrives and based on the available information on the network connections and the states of the edge and the cloud. having extended edgecloudsim to provide support for such dynamic decision making, we are able to compare this approach against iot-first, edge-first, cloud-only, random and application-oriented probabilistic strategies. our simulations on four different types of iot applications show that allowing customisation and dynamic offloading decision support can improve drastically the response time of time-critical and small-size applications, and the energy consumption not only of the individual iot devices but also of the system as a whole. this paves the way for future iot devices that optimise their application response times, as well as their own energy autonomy and overall energy efficiency, in a decentralised and autonomous manner.	internet of things; iot offloading; computation offloading; edge computing; cloud computing; decision support; edgecloudsim simulator	intrusion detection; mobile edge; computation; optimization; workload
simulation of watchdog placement for cooperative anomaly detection in bluetooth mesh intrusion detection system	 	cyber-attacks on the internet of things (iot) are growing at an alarming rate as iot technologies are literally connecting everything into networks. in 2020 more than 25% of identified attacks in enterprises will involve the iot. hence, it is very important to treat iot security as a mandatory design factor. moreover the deployed iot system should be continuously monitored to detect malicious behaviour such as packet dropping, worm propagation or jammer attacks. in the paper we propose the anomaly based intrusion detection system dedicated to bluetooth mesh networks. the machine learning algorithm is used to classify traffic and detect malicious behaviour in iot networks. the proposed solution involve cooperative decision making which is done by multiple watchdogs distributed in different regions of the considered network - which are responsible for processing of mostly local traffic. the optimal placement of watchdogs is proposed based on simulations done by bmwatchsim software. the experimental results coming from our testbed confirm that the watchdog placement proposed by simulator allow on effective detection of real-world intrusions.	internet of things; bluetooth mesh; simulation; intrusion detection system; security; watchdog; placement; cooperation; fog computing	internet
phyalert: identity spoofing attack detection and prevention for a wireless edge network	 	delivering service intelligence to billions of connected devices is the next step in edge computing. wi-fi, as the de facto standard for high-throughput wireless connectivity, is highly vulnerable to packet-injection-based identity spoofing attacks (pi-isas). an attacker can spoof as the legitimate edge coordinator and perform denial of service (dos) or even man-in-the-middle (mitm) attacks with merely a laptop. such vulnerability leads to serious systematic risks, especially for the core edge/cloud backbone network.in this paper, we propose phyalert, an identity spoofing attack alert system designed to protect a wi-fi-based edge network. phyalert profiles the wireless link with the rich dimensional wi-fi phy layer information and enables real-time authentication for wi-fi frames. we prototype phyalert with commercial off-the-shelf (cots) devices and perform extensive experiments in different scenarios. the experiments verify the feasibility of spoofing detection based on phy layer information and show that phyalert can achieve an 8x improvement in the false positive rate over the conventional signal-strength-based solution.	identity spoofing attack; channel state information; wireless intrusion detection; wi-fi	authentication
a systematic survey of industrial internet of things security: requirements and fog computing opportunities	 	a key application of the internet of things (iot) paradigm lies within industrial contexts. indeed, the emerging industrial internet of things (iiot), commonly referred to as industry 4.0, promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices, and the combination of emerging computing technologies, such as fog/cloud computing and artificial intelligence. the iiot is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. indeed, iot security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of iiot technology. unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. to get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity. this paper consists of two contributions: our primary contribution is a systematic review of the literature over the period 2011-2019 on iiot security, focusing in particular on the security requirements of the iiot. our secondary contribution is a reflection on how the relatively new paradigm of fog computing can be leveraged to address these requirements, and thus improve the security of the iiot.	internet of things; edge computing; systematics; tutorials; industries; access control; industrial internet of things; cyber-security; security requirements; fog computing	certificateless signature scheme; intrusion detection; anomaly detection; access-control; iot; blockchain; privacy; communication; framework; authentication
neural networks-aided insider attack detection for the average consensus algorithm	 	to support the big-data processing needs of large-scale deployments of smart devices, there is significant interest in moving from cloud-computing to multi-agent (fog-computing) models, given these algorithms scalability and self-healing properties with respect to nodes and link failures. however, these algorithms are often based on the average consensus primitive, which is, unfortunately, vulnerable to data injection attacks. recognizing this challenge, this work proposes three novel methods for detecting and localizing adversarial nodes using neural network (nn) models. the methods proposed are based on fully distributed algorithms, wherein each node locally updates its local states by exchanging information with its neighbors without supervision. compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach leverages the automatic learning characteristics of nn to reduce the dependence on pre-designed models and human expertise in complex internal attack scenarios. simulation results show that the nn-based methods can significantly improve the attacker detection and localization performance.	artificial neural networks; peer-to-peer computing; protocols; cloud computing; intrusion detection; simulation; gossip algorithm; average consensus; neural network (nn); insider attack; detection and localization	distributed resource-allocation; intrusion detection; internet
covert channels-based stealth attacks in industry 4.0	 	industry 4.0 advent opens several cyber-threats scenarios originally designed for classic information technology (it), drawing the attention to serious risks for the modern industrial control networks. to cope with this problem, in this paper, we address the security issues related to covert channels applied to industrial networks, identifying the new vulnerability points when its converge with operational technologies such as edge computing infrastructures. specifically, we define two signaling strategies where we exploit the modbus/transmission control protocol (tcp) as target to set up a covert channel. once the threat channel is established, passive and active offensive methodologies are further exploited by implementing and testing them on a real industrial internet of things testbed. the experimental results highlight the potential damage of such specific threats and the easy extrapolation of the attacks to other types of channels in order to show the new risks for the industry 4.0. related to this, we discuss some countermeasures offering an overview of possible mitigation and defensive measures.	command and control (c&c); covert channel; data exfiltration; industry 4.0; stealth attacks	intrusion detection
immune system for the internet of things using edge technologies	 	the internet of things (iot) and edge computing are starting to go hand in hand. by providing cloud services close to end-users, edge paradigms enhance the functionality of iot deployments, and facilitate the creation of novel services such as augmented systems. furthermore, the very nature of these paradigms also enables the creation of a proactive defense architecture, an immune system, which allows authorized immune cells (e.g., virtual machines) to traverse edge nodes and analyze the security and consistency of the underlying iot infrastructure. in this paper, we analyze the requirements for the development of an immune system for the iot, and propose a security architecture that satisfies these requirements. we also describe how such a system can be instantiated in edge computing infrastructures using existing technologies. finally, we explore the potential application of immune systems to other scenarios and purposes.	edge computing; immune systems; internet of things (iot); security	intrusion detection; security; privacy
fog-based distributed intrusion detection system against false metering attacks in smart grid	 	in order to secure smart metering infrastructure against false data injection attacks in smart grid, we propose in this paper a new hierarchical and distributed intrusion detection system (hd-ids). the proposed hd-ids is based on distributed fog architecture using three hierarchical network levels (i.e., home area network, residential area network, and fog operation center network). at each network level, we implement an ids; thus, the system ensures three protection and detection levels. the problem is modeled using stochastic markov chain process illustrating the transitions between different smart meter states. the advantage of the proposed hd-ids solution is proved using extensive simulations over different performance metrics and compared with centralized architectures. the implementation is based on real-word traces of electricity consumption of the city of toronto.	smart metering; ids; fog computing; false metering attacks; markov chain; smart grid	infrastructure; architecture; key
high-performance, platform-independent ddos detection for iot ecosystems	 	most distributed denial of service (ddos) detection and mitigation strategies for internet of things (iot) are based on a remote cloud server or purpose-built middlebox executing complex intrusion detection methods, that impose stringent scalability and performance requirements on the iot due to the vast amounts of traffic and devices to be handled. in this paper, we present an edge-based detection scheme using bpfabric, a high-speed, programmable data-plane switch architecture, and lightweight network functions to execute upstream anomaly detection. the proposed detection scheme ensures fast detection of ddos attacks originated from iot devices, while guaranteeing minimum resource usage and processing overhead. our solution was compared against two widespread coarse-grained detection techniques, showing detection delays under 5ms, an overall accuracy of 93 - 95% and a bandwidth overhead of less than 1%.	internet of things; ddos; anomaly detection; dataplane programmability; bpfabric; edge computing	attack detection
ip network anomaly detection using machine learning	 	the proliferation of network technologies and its associated threats have made it indispensable to develop different techniques to effectively detect network attacks. the present paper focuses on discovering viable anomalies that have a significant potential to be associated with abnormal network behavior. three approaches based on ml (machine learning) have been proposed to detect suspicious network behavior. these methods are an extension of the techniques discussed as part of the introduction below. the developed approaches in the current paper are evaluated by testing their efficiency against a real-time network attack using available open-source network tools. the results of the experiment demonstrate successful identification of anomalous instances from the telemetry data with a low false alarm rate. further, we believe that our approaches can be directly deployed in a real-time environment (independently on the edge device or over the cloud) to strengthen the network security.	anomaly detection; network traffic; network attack; multivariate gaussian; k-means; lstm; intrusion detection and intrusion prevention	
kingfisher: an industrial security framework based on variational autoencoders	 	the recent evolution of edge computing favored the industrial internet of things (iiot) growth, opening dangerous surfaces of vulnerabilities. in this distributed sensor system scenario, due to the insecure interactions between information technology (it) and operational technology (ot) networks, cyber-physical threats could lead to destructive consequences for environments and population safety. to deal with industrial cyber-physical security, modern anomaly detection systems implement innovative machine learning (ml) techniques. unfortunately, current solutions still fail to provide an effective prevention to complex industrial threats. in this paper, we present kingfisher, an intrusion detection system (ids) framework based on ml. kingfisher is, to the best of our knowledge, the first solution that looks independently at it and ot traffic, but also from sensors deployed to capture side-channel physical processes data (e.g., vibrations, background noise). thanks to this feature, kingfisher can detect attacks that other systems would ignore. as our tests report, the correlation of inferred physical processes status with ot-network and it-network data can give insights into suspicious and anomalous activities targeting industrial networks. for our framework, we use the variational autoencoders (vaes), an unsupervised neural network model, to categorize data without a priori knowledge of the dataset. we evaluate the detection capabilities and performances of kingfisher in a proof of concept simulated industrial scenario under cyber-physical attacks. our preliminary results show that kingfisher identifies attacks on both network and physical layers.	machine learning; anomaly detection; industrial control system; cyber-physical system; security	anomaly detection
intrusion detection at the network edge: solutions, limitations, and future directions	 	the low-latency, high bandwidth capabilities promised by 5g, together with the diffusion of applications that require high computing power and, again, low latency (such as videogames), are probably the main reasons-though not the only one-that have led to the introduction of a new network architecture: fog computing, that consists in moving the computation services geographically close to where computing is needed. this architectural shift moves security and privacy issues from the cloud to the different layers of the fog architecture. in this scenario, idss are still necessary, but they need to be contextualized in the new architecture. indeed, while on the one hand fog computing provides intrinsic benefits (e.g., low latency), on the other hand, it introduces new design challenges. in this paper, we provide the following contributions: we analyze the possible ids solutions that can be adopted within the different fog computing tiers, together with their related deployment and design challenges; and, we propose some promising future directions, by taking into account the challenges left uncovered by the considered solutions.		lightweight; framework; security; privacy

iot-fog-cloud model for anomaly detection using improved naive bayes and principal component analysis	 	internet of things (iot) is one of the significant emerging domains in computing. iot structures the base of future infrastructures, developing the advancement of future smart cities that are naturally moderate. however, iot is vulnerable to different cyber-attacks. the most critical issues of the iot are security and privacy. in this research, the integration of iot with cloud and fog computing can present an improved platform to support iot smart city applications. cloud computing can provide data storage at top-level management and fog computing can offer various services for supporting smart city applications based on iot. the integrated architecture of the iot-fog-cloud computing model is presented in this research. for the analysis based on network-based intrusion detection system (nids) anomaly detection, the improved naive bayes (inb) classifier based on principal component analysis (pca) technique is proposed in this work. the unsw-nb15 dataset is used for the evaluation of the attack detection model. the pca technique is used to extract features of the dataset, and the inb classifier is used for the classification of attacks. this technique is proposed to enhance the efficiency of the anomaly detection and to improve the performance analysis in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and detection rate. the inb-pca achieved 92.48% accuracy and 95.35% detection rate.	iot; fog computing; cloud computing; cyber-attacks; anomaly detection; improved na&#239; ve bayes; principal component analysis; unsw-nb15 dataset	
design and implementation of virtual security function based on multiple enclaves	 	network function virtualization (nfv) provides flexible and scalable network function for the emerging platform, such as the cloud computing, edge computing, and iot platforms, while it faces more security challenges, such as tampering with network policies and leaking sensitive processing states, due to running in a shared open environment and lacking the protection of proprietary hardware. currently, intel(r) software guard extensions (sgx) provides a promising way to build a secure and trusted vnf (virtual network function) by isolating vnf or sensitive data into an enclave. however, directly placing multiple vnfs in a single enclave will lose the scalability advantage of nfv. this paper combines sgx and click technology to design the virtual security function architecture based on multiple enclaves. in our design, the sensitive modules of a vnf are put into different enclaves and communicate by local attestation. the system can freely combine these modules according to user requirements, and increase the scalability of the system while protecting its running state security. in addition, we design a new hot-swapping scheme to enable the system to dynamically modify the configuration function at runtime, so that the original vnfs do not need to stop when the function of vnfs is modified. we implement an ids (intrusion detection system) based on our architecture to verify the feasibility of our system and evaluate its performance. the results show that the overhead introduced by the system architecture is within an acceptable range.	nfv; sgx; enclave; hot swapping; click

a distributed ensemble design based intrusion detection system using fog computing to protect the internet of things networks	 	with the development of internet of things (iot), capabilities of computing, networking infrastructure, storage of data and management have come very close to the edge of networks. this has accelerated the necessity of fog computing paradigm. due to availability of internet, most of our business operations are integrated with iot platform. fog computing has enhanced the strategy of collecting and processing, huge amount of data. on the other hand, attacks and malicious activities has adverse consequences on the development of iot, fog, and cloud computing. this has led to development of many security models using fog computing to protect iot network. therefore, for dynamic and highly scalable iot environment, a distributed architecture based intrusion detection system (ids) is required that can distribute the existing centralized computing to local fog nodes and can efficiently detect modern iot attacks. this paper proposes a novel distributed ensemble design based ids using fog computing, which combines k-nearest neighbors, xgboost, and gaussian naive bayes as first-level individual learners. at second-level, the prediction results obtained from first level is used by random forest for final classification. most of the existing proposals are tested using kdd99 or nsl-kdd dataset. however, these datasets are obsolete and lack modern iot-based attacks. in this paper, unsw-nb15 and actual iot-based dataset namely, ds2os are used for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed system. the experimental result revealed that the proposed distributed ids with unsw-nb15 can achieve higher detection rate upto 71.18% for backdoor, 68.98% for analysis, 92.25% for reconnaissance and 85.42% for dos attacks. similarly, with ds2os dataset, detection rate is upto 99.99% for most of the attack vectors.	intrusion detection system; anomaly detection; ensemble learning; fog computing; internet of things (iot); feature selection	security
protedge: a few-shot ensemble learning approach to software-defined networking-assisted edge security	 	the rise of the internet of things (iot) paradigm has had a significant impact on our lives through many use cases including smart farming, smart homes, and smart healthcare among others. due to the capacity-constrained nature of many iot devices, edge computing has become a significant aid for iot, replacing cloud computing to support the extremely low latency requirements. with the number of smart devices growing exponentially, the large attack surface created by these devices is concerning. software-defined networking (sdn) based architectures come to the rescue of edge-assisted iot environments to achieve enhanced security, and they strongly rely on intelligent decision-making capabilities to act upon the high volume of traffic they control. machine learning-based intelligence is already utilized by these systems with successful results when abundant training data are available; however, most algorithms fail in the lack of sufficient training data. in this article, we propose protedge, an sdn-based intelligent security architecture for edge-assisted iot networks, which utilizes a few-shot learning classifier, namely prototypical networks, for highly accurate detection of intrusions. we evaluate the performance of the proposed model with the bot-iot data set consisting of real-world iot network flows, as well as an sdn data set modeling an edge-assisted iot environment and the unsw-nb15 data set, and show that the proposed model achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art models in the absence of large amounts of sample attacks. the proposed architecture is promising to achieve intelligent security in future's ubiquitous edge-enabled iot with its low processing overhead and high intrusion detection accuracy.		as-a-service; intrusion detection; iot; internet; things; attack; svm
an anomaly mitigation framework for iot using fog computing	 	the advancement in iot has prompted its application in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, etc., and this has aided its exponential growth. however, alongside this development, iot networks are experiencing a rise in security challenges such as botnet attacks, which often appear as network anomalies. similarly, providing security solutions has been challenging due to the low resources that characterize the devices in iot networks. to overcome these challenges, the fog computing paradigm has provided an enabling environment that offers additional resources for deploying security solutions such as anomaly mitigation schemes. in this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly mitigation framework for iot using fog computing to ensure faster and accurate anomaly detection. the framework employs signature- and anomaly-based detection methodologies for its two modules, respectively. the signature-based module utilizes a database of attack sources (blacklisted ip addresses) to ensure faster detection when attacks are executed from the blacklisted ip address, while the anomaly-based module uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm for accurate classification of network traffic flow into normal or abnormal. we evaluated the performance of both modules using an iot-based dataset in terms response time for the signature-based module and accuracy in binary and multiclass classification for the anomaly-based module. the results show that the signature-based module achieves a fast attack detection of at least six times faster than the anomaly-based module in each number of instances evaluated. the anomaly-based module using the xgboost classifier detects attacks with an accuracy of 99% and at least 97% for average recall, average precision, and average f1 score for binary and multiclass classification. additionally, it recorded 0.05 in terms of false-positive rates.	anomaly mitigation; internet of things (iot); intrusion detection system (ids); fog computing; classification algorithms	intrusion detection system; internet; security; things; attack; schemes
packet-based intrusion detection using bayesian topic models in mobile edge computing	 	in this paper, a network intrusion detection system is proposed using bayesian topic model latent dirichlet allocation (lda) for mobile edge computing (mec). the method employs tcpdump packets and extracts multiple features from the packet headers. the tcpdump packets are transferred into documents based on the features. a topic model is trained using only attack-free traffic in order to learn the behavior patterns of normal traffic. then, the test traffic is analyzed against the learned behavior patterns to measure the extent to which the test traffic resembles the normal traffic. a threshold is defined in the training phase as the minimum likelihood of a host. in the test phase, when a host's test traffic has a likelihood lower than the host's threshold, the traffic is labeled as an intrusion. the intrusion detection system is validated using darpa 1999 dataset. experiment shows that our method is suitable to protect the security of mec.		nearest neighbors; system; selection
an edge ids based on biological immune principles for dynamic threat detection	 	edge computing solves such questions as the massive multisource data and resource consuming computing tasks in edge devices. some new security problems especially the data security and privacy issues have been introduced into the edge computing scenario. through analyzing the biological immune principles, a novel idea for the problem of intrusion detection in edge computing is provided. specifically, an edge intrusion detection system (edge ids) with a distributed structure, which has the characteristics of an imprecise model, self-learning, and strong interactivity, is constructed in a systematic way inspired by the biological immune principles. moreover, a newly proposed gene immune detection algorithm (gida) is designed. in order that edge ids can deal with the dynamic data problem efficiently, the key functional components such as the remaining gene, niching strategy, and extracting vaccine are embedded into the gida algorithm. furthermore, extensive simulation experiments are conducted, and the results show that the proposed edge ids can be adapted to the domain of edge computing with comparative performance advantages.		intrusion-detection; security; internet; system
anomaly detection for industrial control system based on autoencoder neural network	 	as the industrial internet of things (iiot) develops rapidly, cloud computing and fog computing become effective measures to solve some problems, e.g., limited computing resources and increased network latency. the industrial control systems (ics) play a key factor within the development of iiot, whose security affects the whole iiot. ics involves many aspects, like water supply systems and electric utilities, which are closely related to people's lives. ics is connected to the internet and exposed in the cyberspace instead of isolating with the outside recent years. the risk of being attacked increases as a result. in order to protect these assets, intrusion detection systems (ids) have drawn much attention. as one kind of intrusion detection, anomaly detection provides the ability to detect unknown attacks compared with signature-based techniques, which are another kind of ids. in this paper, an anomaly detection method with a composite autoencoder model learning the normal pattern is proposed. unlike the common autoencoder neural network that predicts or reconstructs data separately, our model makes prediction and reconstruction on input data at the same time, which overcomes the shortcoming of using each one alone. with the error obtained by the model, a change ratio is put forward to locate the most suspicious devices that may be under attack. in the last part, we verify the performance of our method by conducting experiments on the swat dataset. the results show that the proposed method exhibits improved performance with 88.5% recall and 87.0% f1-score.

quantum identity authentication protocol based on three-photon quantum error avoidance code in edge computing	 	information security protection is always one of very significant and fundamental issues in edge computing, generally including cryptography, authentication, intrusion detection, privacy protection, and other technologies, and so forth. quantum authentication is one of the latest extensions of authentication technology in quantum field. so far, most of the quantum identity authentication protocols proposed are based on noise-free environments. however, due to the existence of quantum noise in quantum channels is inevitable, the noise immunity is very important to quantum identity authentication. in this article, a novel quantum identity authentication protocol based on three-photon error avoidance code is proposed. in this protocol, quantum information is encoded on the noiseless subsystem, so the protocol can effectively resist on the interference of noise in the quantum channel to information transmission. the comprehensive analysis of antinoise performance and the security analysis on various eavesdropping attacks shows that the new protocol proposed in this article has not only good antinoise performance but also good security.		computation offloading method; joint remote preparation; arbitrary 2-qubit state; privacy preservation; noisy environment; entangled-state; big-data
security analytics for real-time forecasting of cyberattacks	 	protection of networked computing infrastructures (such as internet of things, industrial control systems, and edge computing) is dependent on the continuous monitoring of interaction between such devices and network/cloud-based hosts (especially in industry 4.0 environments). this real-time monitoring enables an analyst to quantify evolving and emerging threats to such network infrastructures. a framework for identifying patterns in observed cyberthreats and the use of these patterns for forecasting the growth of an emerging threat to network infrastructure is proposed. this framework enables predicting the maximum threat intensity and the time period over which this maximum intensity is likely to occur. the proposed framework integrates: (a) continuous monitoring of device/network activity, (b) forecasting behavior using exponentially weighted moving averages, (c) utilizing fibonacci retracement for estimating the potential intensity of a cyberattack, and (d) linear regression for predicting response time for high risk thresholds and a machine learning strategy to predict potential risk over a pre-defined time window. using this approach, we can produce time intervals between the forecast and the actual attacks using real-world network activity data. our results show an average lead time of around 1.75 hours, providing a window of opportunity to limit the impact of an attack and counter it.	cybersecurity; malware; security risk; web security	intrusion detection; prediction
designing efficient sinkhole attack detection mechanism in edge-based iot deployment	 	the sinkhole attack in an edge-based internet of things (iot) environment (eiot) can devastate and ruin the whole functioning of the communication. the sinkhole attacker nodes (sha s) have some properties (for example, they first attract the other normal nodes for the shortest path to the destination and when normal nodes initiate the process of sending their packets through that path (i.e., via sha), the attacker nodes start disrupting the traffic flow of the network). in the presence of shas, the destination (for example, sink node i.e., gateway/base station) does not receive the required information or it may receive partial or modified information. this results in reduction of the network performance and degradation in efficiency and reliability of the communication. in the presence of such an attack, the throughput decreases, end-to-end delay increases and packet delivery ratio decreases. moreover, it may harm other network performance parameters. hence, it becomes extremely essential to provide an effective and competent scheme to mitigate this attack in eiot. in this paper, an intrusion detection scheme to protect eiot environment against sinkhole attack is proposed, which is named as sad-eiot. in sad-eiot, the resource rich edge nodes (edge servers) perform the detection of different types of sinkhole attacker nodes with the help of exchanging messages. the practical demonstration of sad-eiot is also provided using the well known ns2 simulator to compute the various performance parameters. additionally, the security analysis of sad-eiot is conducted to prove its resiliency against various types of shas. sad-eiot achieves around 95.83% detection rate and 1.03% false positive rate, which are considerably better than other related existing schemes. apart from those, sad-eiot is proficient with respect to computation and communication costs. eventually, sad-eiot will be a suitable match for those applications which can be used in critical and sensitive operations (for example, surveillance, security and monitoring systems).	sinkhole attack; internet of things (iot); intrusion detection; edge computing; ns2 simulation; security	user authentication scheme; intrusion detection system; rpl-based internet; wireless; security; mitigation; performance; things

fog-based attack detection framework for internet of things using deep learning	 	the number of cyber-attacks and data breaches has immensely increased across different enterprises, companies, and industries as a result of the exploitation of the weaknesses in securing internet of things (iot) devices. the increasing number of various devices connected to iot and their different protocols has led to growing volume of zero-day attacks. deep learning (dl) has demonstrated its superiority in big data fields and cyber-security. recently, dl has been used in cyber-attacks detection because of its capability of extracting and learning deep features of known attacks and detecting unknown attacks without the need for manual feature engineering. however, dl cannot be implemented on iot devices with limited resources because it requires extensive computation, strong power and storage capabilities. this paper presents a comprehensive attack detection framework of a distributed, robust, and high detection rate to detect several iot cyber-attacks using dl. the proposed framework implements an attack detector on fog nodes because of its distributed nature, high computational capacity and proximity to edge devices. six dl models are compared to identify the dl model with the best performance. all dl models are evaluated using five different datasets, each of which involves various attacks. experiments show that the long short-term memory model outperforms the five other dl models. the proposed framework is effective in terms of response time and detection accuracy and can detect several types of cyber-attacks with 99.97 & x0025; detection rate and 99.96 & x0025; detection accuracy in binary classification and 99.65 & x0025; detection accuracy in multi-class classification.	computational modeling; feature extraction; edge computing; image edge detection; security; internet of things; machine learning; attack detection; cybersecurity; deep learning; fog computing; long short term memory; internet of things	intrusion detection; security
anomaly behavior analysis for fog nodes availability assurance in iot applications	 	the internet of things (iot) is the new trend to make devices interact among themselves. the iot will connect not only computers and mobile devices, but also wearable devices, smart buildings, smart cities, electrical grids, and automobiles just to name few. iot will lead to the development of a wide range of advanced information services that need to be processed in real-time and require large storage and computational power than can be provided by cloud and fog computing. the integration of iot with cloud and fog computing make iot capable of processing large-scale geo-distributed information. in any iot application, communications are critical to deliver the required information to the end user, device or application, for instance to take actions during crisis events. however, iot communication elements such as gateways or fog nodes, will introduce major security challenges as they contribute to increase the attack surface, preventing the iot to deliver accurate information. in this paper, we propose a methodology to develop an intrusion detection system (ids) based on anomaly behavior analysis (aba) to detect when a fog node has been compromised. the preliminary experimental results show that our proposed approach accurately detects known and unknown anomalies due to misuses or cyber-attacks, with high detection rate and low false alarms.	internet of things; cloud computing; fog computing; anomaly behavior analysis; intrusion detection system	things; internet; framework; resilient; security
situation aware intrusion detection system design for industrial iot gateways	 	in today's iiot world, most of the iot platform providers like microsoft, amazon and google are focused towards connecting devices and extract data from the devices and send the data to the cloud for analytics. only there are few companies concentrating on security measures implemented on edge node. gartner estimates that by 2020, more than 25 percent of all enterprise attackers will make use of the industrial iot. as cyber security threat is getting more important, it is essential to ensure protection of data both at rest and at motion. the reflex of cyber security in the industrial iot domain is much more severe when compared to the consumer iot segment. the new bottleneck in this are security services which employ computationally intensive software operations and system services [1]. resilient services consume considerable resources in a design. when such measures are added to thwart security attacks, the resource requirements grow even more demanding. since the standard iiot gateways and other sub devices are resource constrained in nature the conventional design for security services will not be applicable in this case. this paper proposes an intelligent architectural paradigm for the constrained iiot gateways that can efficiently identify the cyber-attacks in the industrial iot domain.	internet of things; industrial iot gateway; cloud computing; iot security	
pidiot: probabilistic intrusion detection for the internet-of-things	 	the internet-of-things promises sweeping change through increased connectivity and ubiquitous integration of technology into our lives. however, as we create economies of scale for data aggregation and processing, we also create attractive targets for various adversaries. in this work we design a lightweight, probabilistic intrusion detection system, or pidiot. we design pidiot to use operational measurements from iot devices, with lightweight hash functions and bloom filters to perform fuzzy anomaly detection. we experiment with iot devices operating in an isolated environment, and we show that we can detect over 90% of simulated attacks. while we do not propose pidiot as a comprehensive solution for iot defense, we make a case for its use as part of a layered defense strategy.	internet of things; intrusion detection; edge computing	
from back-of-the-envelope to informed estimation of edge computing benefits in minutes using castnet	 	multi-access edge computing (mec) is emerging as the next evolution in computing infrastructure. however, broad adoption of edge computing solutions is still lagging behind. we posit that a significant factor contributing to this trend is related to the challenges in evaluating the trade-offs offered by edge computing and answering a simple question: will the edge investments be offset with commensurate gains in performance metrics such as improved application responsiveness or lower backhaul bandwidth costs? existing simulation tools, developed for cloud computing and networking research, require a large amount of effort to be applied to the edge computing space. their native abstractions and interfaces pose limitations in how such frameworks can be extended to allow for characterization and analysis of diverse edge computing use cases. moreover, as we demonstrate, they can be slow, taking days, to provide insights. to address this gap, we develop castnet - a fast, extensible, and easy-to-use framework for evaluating the benefits of mec for different edge deployment models, configuration and functions. we demonstrate that castnet leads to significant gains in the time-to-insight, while achieving the same fidelity in the results as existing tools. we illustrate the utility of castnet using two scenarios: investigation of the impact of edge storage capacity for edge-based content caches, and the impact of edge location for an edge-based intrusion detection service.	edge computing; edge cloud; edge simulators	
intrusion detection classification model on an improved k-dependence bayesian network	 	edge computing extends traditional cloud services to the edge of the network, and the highly dynamic and heterogeneous environment at the edge of the network makes the network security situation facing severe challenges. therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study and build a high-precision intrusion detection classification model (idcm) for network security in the emerging edge computing mode. this paper studies an improved k-dependency bayesian network (kdbn) structural model that can accurately describe the dependence relationships among system variables and reduce the complexity of the bayesian network structure by reducing the directed edges of weak dependence. on this basis, this paper constructs an idcm based on improved kdbn by introducing the maximum a posterior criterion and a virtual augmentation method for samples of small category. the experiments use the kddcup99 (10%) intrusion detection data set for verification, which show that the idcm based on improved kdbn has high efficiency, high detection accuracy and high stability, which optimally addresses the issues discussed in many references, such as low detection accuracy and poor stability, for small categories (u2r and r2l) in the kddcup99 (10%) intrusion detection data set.	idcm; kdbn; network security; virtual augmentation method

a framework for improving network resilience using sdn and fog nodes	 	the iot (internet of things) is one of the primary reasons for the massive growth in the number of connected devices to the internet, thus leading to an increased volume of traffic in the core network. fog and edge computing are becoming a solution to handle iot traffic by moving time-sensitive processing to the edge of the network, while using the conventional cloud for historical analysis and long-term storage. providing processing, storage, and network communication at the edge network are the aim of fog computing to reduce delay, network traffic, and decentralise computing. in this paper, we define a framework that realises fog computing that can be extended to install any service of choice. our framework utilises fog nodes as an extension of the traditional switch to include processing, networking, and storage. the fog nodes act as local decision-making elements that interface with software-defined networking (sdn), to be able to push updates throughout the network. to test our framework, we develop an ip spoofing security application and ensure its correctness through multiple experiments.	resilience; survivability; future internet; iot; sdn; openflow; cloud and fog computing; openfog; network security; ip spoofing; intrusion detection; mininet network simulator	
optimization scheme for intrusion detection scheme gbdt in edge computing center	 	combination of edge computing technologies and machine learning help to put edge intelligence into practice. industrial internet of things (iiot) is one of its most typical applications. but this system can be easily attacked in the process of using edge computing center to process localized perception data. intrusion detection technologies based on machine learning provide strong security for edge computing center, in which the most widely used is gradient boosting decision tree (i.e., gbdt). but still this model faces with problems such as imbalanced data, high dimensional data characteristics, and low efficiency of parameter optimization. to solve these problems, this paper proposes an optimization scheme for gbdt to improve its detection precision and training efficiency. first, to solve the problem of imbalanced data in data set, we propose a margin synthetic minority oversampling technique (i.e., msmote), which can expand the non-noise data with less sample size, namely, small sample, to ensure equilibrium distribution of data. second, to lower the data feature dimensionality, we propose a recursive feature elimination-hierarchy cross validation algorithm (i.e., rfe-hcv). the new algorithm eliminates redundant data features recursively according to feature weight, to strengthen the relationship between features and goals. it also designs hierarchy system to ensure equal proportionment of data category (attack category) in training set and testing set at cross validation stage. next, in order to improve the efficiency of parameter optimization in model training process, we develop a flexible grid search algorithm (i.e., fgs) to improve retrieval efficiency of optimum parameters. finally, the detailed experimental results show that our new scheme ensures data balance in dataset and eliminates redundant data features, and helps the efficiency of parameter optimization increase by three times. moreover, the new scheme defends against intrusion more effectively.

ad hoc vehicular fog enabling cooperative low-latency intrusion detection	 	internet of vehicles and vehicular networks have been compelling targets for malicious security attacks where several intrusion detection solutions have been proposed for protecting them. nonetheless, their main problem lies in their heavy computation, which makes them unsuitable for next-generation artificial intelligence-powered self-driving vehicles whose computational power needs to be primarily reserved for real-time driving decisions. to address this challenge, several approaches have been lately presented to take advantage of the cloud computing for offloading intrusion detection tasks to central cloud servers, thus reducing storage and processing costs on vehicles. however, centralized cloud computing entails high latency on intrusion detection related data transmission and plays against its adoption in delay-critical intelligent applications. in this context, this article proposes a vehicular-edge computing (vec) fog-enabled scheme allowing offloading intrusion detection tasks to federated vehicle nodes located within nearby formed ad hoc vehicular fog to be cooperatively executed with minimal latency. the problem has been formulated as a multiobjective optimization model and solved using a genetic algorithm maximizing offloading survivability in the presence of high mobility and minimizing computation execution time and energy consumption. experiments performed on resource-constrained devices within actual ad hoc fog environment illustrate that our solution significantly reduces the execution time of the detection process while maximizing the offloading survivability under different real-life scenarios.

p2idf: a privacy-preserving based intrusion detection framework for software defined internet of things-fog (sdiot-fog)	 	the software defined internet of things-fog (sdiot-fog) has provided a new connectivity paradigm for effective service provisioning. sdiot-fog uses network resource virtualization to provide services to heterogeneous iot devices. however, data privacy, and security are the two major challenges that prevents faster realization of sdiot-based frameworks. motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we present a privacy-preserving based intrusion detection framework (p2idf) for protecting confidential data and to detect malicious instances in sdiot-fog network traffic. this framework has two key engines. firstly, a sparse autoencoder (sae)-based privacy-preservation engine is suggested that transforms original data into a new encoded form that avoids inference attacks. secondly, an intrusion detection engine is suggested that uses artificial neural network (ann) to train and evaluate the outcomes of the proposed privacy-preservation engine using an iot-based dataset named ton-iot. finally, experimental results showed that the proposed p2idf framework outperforms with some recent state-of-the-art frameworks in terms of detection rate, accuracy and precision score.

identification of a malicious optical edge device in the sdn-based optical fog/cloud computing network	 	software-defined networking (sdn) and optical transmission are the most cost-effective technologies for implementing high-bandwidth-based communication in the fog/cloud computing environment. the passive optical network uses optical line terminals and optical network units as optical edge devices (oeds) to deliver fog/cloud-based services effectively. the security of such oeds is one of the key issues for successful implementation of fog/cloud computing over the sdn-based optical network. the main security challenge is to detect and prevent the malicious oed that transmitting abusing data-frames in the sdn-based optical fog/cloud computing network. an oed can be easily hacked by the attacker to launch intrusive attacks those affect the quality of service of the optical channel. in this paper, a secure framework is proposed for identifying malicious oed in the fog/cloud computing over the sdn-based optical network. it identifies the malicious oed and shifts it to the honeypot to mitigate and analyze the attack. it uses two-stage hidden markov model (hmm), intrusion detection system (ids)-based fog manager and an optical virtual honeypot device (ovhd). a two-stage hmm is effectively used to reduce the false alarms of ids in the identification of malicious oed and shifting it onto the ovhd. the ovhd is created in the sdn-based optical network by using the concept of free-available-resource and optical network virtualization. the proposed ovhd logs all malicious activities as well as attacker's path for preventing future attacks. in order to validate the proposed framework, the simulation of two-stage hmm is implemented in matlab and mitigation impacts of the internal attacks are studied by using ifogsim toolkit. the results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

a comparative study of techniques, datasets and performances for intrusion detection systems in iot	 	iot security is the area concerned with safeguarding connected systems. iot involves the set-up of various integrated devices. devices are identified with a unique identifier, and provided with the ability to transfer data over the network opens them up to several serious vulnerabilities, if not appropriately protected. an intrusion detection and prevention system (idps) plays a crucial part in discovering and preventing numerous attacks entering the network and provide an uncompromised secure system. the sheer volume of the sensors in a system comes with limitations such as interoperability, scalability, and storage, where security algorithms like ids couldnât perform well as it requires a huge amount of labelled data for training, to detect intrusions and ascertain new attacks. fog computing plays a major role with a decentralized architecture allows iot devices to compute, make decisions, take actions, and push only relevant information to the cloud. data availability is closer and can act immediately for the sensitive information, which in turn helps the ids to perform well using artificial intelligence algorithm to detect and prevent various attacks. this paper categorizes the existing recent researches in iot intrusion detection systems using artificial intelligence and fog computing architecture in terms of technical constraints.

anomaly detection in distribution power system based on a condition monitoring vector and ultra- short demand forecasting	 	this paper presents a proactive intrusion detection system (ids) for smart distribution power systems. the considered attack scenario is manipulation of the advanced measuring infrastructures (amis) readings and/or smart inverters data. these manipulated data from the grid edge devices mislead the grid operator for making proper operational planning decisions. in a stealthy attack model, where the attacker compromises significant number of these smart devices, serious demand-supply unbalance can occur that may result in major blackouts. the proposed ids is based on a condition monitoring vector (cmv) equipped with a learned ultra-short-term demand forecasting (ustdf) mechanism. this cybersecurity approach is able to verify smart devices readings. in the proposed method, the instantaneous difference of collected amis and other smart devices data with the ultra-short term forecasted demand is defined as the cmv. this vector probes a pre-defined error band for identifying the compromised smart devices. the learned ustdf mechanism is based on the distribution grid historical load profile and the temperature data for the goal area. an accurate multi-dimensional regression model is developed and learned for forecasting the load behavior in this area. finally, the suspicious areas are flagged or become separated from the main grid by the network operator based on the proposed cmv outcomes and the output of decision-making module. the proposed ids aims to enhance the cybersecurity of the smart devices at the grid-edge that plays major role in ensuring the resiliency of the grid. the theoretical analyses are verified by several case studies.

dynamic orchestration of security services at fog nodes for 5g iot	 	fog computing is one of the edge computing paradigms that envisages being the proximate processing and storage infrastructure for a multitude of iot appliances. with its dynamic deployability as a medium level cloud service, fog nodes are enabling heterogeneous service provisioning infrastructure that features scalability, interoperability, and adaptability. out of the various 5g based services possible with the fog computing platforms, security services are imperative but minimally investigated direct live. thus, in this research, we are focused on launching security services in a fog node with an architecture capable of provisioning on-demand service requests. as the fog nodes are constrained on resources, our intention is to integrate light-weight virtualization technology such as docker for forming the service provisioning infrastructure. we managed to launch multiple security instances configured to be intrusion detection and prevention systems (idpss) on the fog infrastructure emulated via a raspberry pi-4 device. this environment was tested with multiple network flows to validate its feasibility. in our proposed architecture, orchestration strategies performed by the security orchestrator were stated as guidelines for achieving pragmatic, dynamic orchestration with fog in iot deployments. the results of this research guarantee the possibility of developing an ambient security service model that facilitates iot devices with enhanced security.

intrusion detection for smart home security based on data augmentation with edge computing	 	smart home is an indispensable part of internet of things(iot) owing to the prompt development and application of smart devices. however, the data collected from smart homes usually need to be processed by a cloud server, which means there is a risk of leaking the privacy of users during the transmission. in this situation, edge computing is considered to be an ideal platform for smart home, which enable data to be processed at edge nodes. unfortunately, because of unsecured wi-fi connection and smart devices, edge nodes also have the possibility to encounter malicious attacks. hence, in this paper, we designed an intrusion detection system (ids) to be deployed on edge nodes. we convert network traffic to images which are applied to train a convolutional neural network (cnn) to classify the categories of network traffic. furthermore, auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (ac-gan) is adopted to generate synthesized samples to expand the intrusion detection dataset. we experiment on the unsw-nb15 dataset which contains substantial network traffic about the normal and anomalies. the proposed scheme is effective to minor categories of which precision could be improved 12%. besides, the precision can reach 96% in binary classification about normal and anomaly.

evaluation of centralised vs distributed collaborative intrusion detection systems in multi-access edge computing	 	with the rapid adoption of next generation networking architectures in 5g, like multi-access edge computing (mec), there is a shift in the core processing capabilities to the edge of the network. this helps facilitate higher bandwidth and ultra-low latency responses, but can increase the attack surface for cyber-attacks like denial of service (dos) and distributed denial of service (ddos). to safeguard these architectures without degrading performance, we require mechanisms capable of detecting these attacks in near-real time. collaborative intrusion detection systems (cids) are a popular choice for detecting sophisticated coordinated attacks in large complex networks, and a prime candidate for use in this context. however, finding the right cids deployment model is not straightforward, with each model presenting its own set of challenges like accuracy as well as network and computational overhead. in this paper, we focus on evaluating two cids models - a centralised vs a distributed approach using distributed hash tables (dhts), based on their detection accuracy, cpu and memory usage, and data transmission overhead. we assess each approach through experimentation with a real-world worm dataset to understand the complexities involved in developing an efficient intrusion detection solution for mec.

security as a service platform leveraging multi-access edge computing infrastructure provisions	 	the mobile service platform envisaged by emerging iot and 5g is guaranteeing gigabit-level bandwidth, ultra-low latency and ultra-high storage capacity for their subscribers. in spite of the variety of applications plausible with the envisaged technologies, security is a demanding objective that should be applied beyond the design stages. thus, security as a service (secaas) is an initiative for a service model that enable mobile and iot consumers with diverse security functions such as intrusion detection and prevention (idpaas), authentication (aaas), and secure transmission channel (stcaas) as a service. a well-equipped edge computing infrastructure is intrinsic to achieve this goal. the emerging multi-access edge computing (mec) paradigm standardized by the etsi is excelling among other edge computing flavours due to its well-defined structure and protocols. thus, in our directive, we intend to utilize mec as the edge computing platform to launch the secaas functions. though, the actual development of a mec infrastructure is highly dependent on the integration of virtualization technologies to enable dynamic creation, the deployment, and the detachment of virtualized entities that should feature interoperability to cater the heterogeneous iot devices and services. to that extent, this work is proposing a security service architecture that offers these secaas services. further, we validate our proposed architecture through the development of a virtualized infrastructure that integrates lightweight and hypervisor-based virtualization technologies. our experiments prove the plausibility of launching multiple security instances on the developed prototype edge platform.

sparseids: learning packet sampling with reinforcement learning	 	recurrent neural networks (rnns) have been shown to be valuable for constructing intrusion detection systems (idss) for network data. they allow determining if a flow is malicious or not already before it is over, making it possible to take action immediately. however, considering the large number of packets that has to be inspected, for example in cloud/fog and edge computing, the question of computational efficiency arises. we show that by using a novel reinforcement learning (rl)-based approach called sparseids, we can reduce the number of consumed packets by more than three fourths while keeping classification accuracy high. to minimize the computational expenses of the rl-based sampling we show that a shared neural network can be used for both the classifier and the rl logic. thus, no additional resources are consumed by the sampling in deployment. comparing to various other sampling techniques, sparseids consistently achieves higher classification accuracy by learning to sample only relevant packets. a major novelty of our rl-based approach is that it can not only skip up to a predefined maximum number of samples like other approaches proposed in the domain of natural language processing but can even skip arbitrarily many packets in one step. this enables saving even more computational resources for long sequences. inspecting sparseids's behavior of choosing packets shows that it adopts different sampling strategies for different attack types and network flows. finally we build an automatic steering mechanism that can guide sparseids in deployment to achieve a desired level of sparsity.

federated mimic learning for privacy preserving intrusion detection	 	internet of things (iot) devices are prone to attacks due to the limitation of their privacy and security components. these attacks vary from exploiting backdoors to disrupting the communication network of the devices. intrusion detection systems (ids) play an essential role in ensuring information privacy and security of iot devices against these attacks. recently, deep learning-based ids techniques are becoming more prominent due to their high classification accuracy. however, conventional deep learning techniques jeopardize user privacy due to the transfer of user data to a centralized server. federated learning (fl) is a popular privacy-preserving decentralized learning method. fl enables training models locally at the edge devices and transferring local models to a centralized server instead of transferring sensitive data. nevertheless, fl can suffer from reverse engineering ml attacks that can learn information about the user's data from model. to overcome the problem of reverse engineering, mimic learning is another way to preserve the privacy of ml-based ids. in mimic learning, a student model is trained with the public dataset, which is labeled with the teacher model that is trained by sensitive user data. in this work, we propose a novel approach that combines the advantages of fl and mimic learning, namely federated mimic learning to create a distributed ids while minimizing the risk of jeopardizing users' privacy, and benchmark its performance compared to other ml-based ids techniques using nsl-kdd dataset. our results show that we can achieve 98.11% detection accuracy with federated mimic learning.

virtual machine introspection for anomaly-based keylogger detection	 	software keyloggers are dominant class of malicious applications that surreptitiously logs all the user activity to gather confidential information. among many other types of keyloggers, api-based keyloggers can pretend as unprivileged program running in a user-space to eavesdrop and record all the keystrokes typed by the user. in a linux environment, defending against these types of malware means defending the kernel against being compromised and it is still an open and difficult problem. considering how recent trend of edge computing extends cloud computing and the internet of things (iot) to the edge of the network, a new types of intrusion-detection system (ids) has been used to mitigate cybersecurity threats in edge computing. proposed work aims to provide secure environment by constantly checking virtual machines for the presence of keyloggers using cutting edge artificial immune system (ais) based technology. the algorithms that exist in the field of ais exploit the immune system's characteristics of learning and memory to solve diverse problems. we further present our approach by employing an architecture where host os and a virtual machine (vm) layer actively collaborate to guarantee kernel integrity. this collaborative approach allows us to introspect vm by tracking events (interrupts, system calls, memory writes, network activities, etc.) and to detect anomalies by employing negative selection algorithm (nsa).

a distributed deep learning system for web attack detection on edge devices	 	with the development of internet of things (iot) and cloud technologies, numerous iot devices and sensors transmit huge amounts of data to cloud data centers for further processing. while providing us considerable convenience, cloud-based computing and storage also bring us many security problems, such as the abuse of information collection and concentrated web servers in the cloud. traditional intrusion detection systems and web application firewalls are becoming incompatible with the new network environment, and related systems with machine learning or deep learning are emerging. however, cloud-iot systems increase attacks against web servers, since data centralization carries a more attractive reward. in this article, based on distributed deep learning, we propose a web attack detection system that takes advantage of analyzing urls. the system is designed to detect web attacks and is deployed on edge devices. the cloud handles the above challenges in the paradigm of the edge of things. multiple concurrent deep models are used to enhance the stability of the system and the convenience in updating. we implemented experiments on the system with two concurrent deep models and compared the system with existing systems by using several datasets. the experimental results with 99.410% in accuracy, 98.91% in true positive rate (tpr), and 99.55% in detection rate of normal requests (drn) demonstrate the system is competitive in detecting web attacks.

an intrusion detection framework for energy constrained iot devices	 	industrial internet of things (iiot) exemplifies iot with applications in manufacturing, surveillance, automotive, smart buildings, homes and transport. it leverages sensor technology, cutting edge communication and data analytics technologies and the open internet to consolidate it and operational technology (ot) aiming to achieve cost and performance benefits. however, the underlying resource constraints and ad hoc nature of such systems have significant implications especially in achieving effective intrusion detection. consequently, contemporary solutions requiring a stable infrastructure and extensive computational resources are inadequate to fulfill these characteristics of an iiot system. in this paper, we propose an intrusion detection framework for the energy-constrained iot devices which form the foundation of an iiot ecosystem. in view of the ad hoc nature of such systems as well as emerging complex threats such as botnets, we assess the feasibility of collaboration between the host (iot devices) and the edge devices for effective intrusion detection whilst minimizing energy consumption and communication overhead. we implemented the proposed framework with contiki operating system and conducted rigorous evaluation to identify potential performance trade-offs. the evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can minimize energy and communication overheads whilst achieving an effective collaborative intrusion detection for iiot systems.

a criterion for ids deployment on iot edge nodes	 	edge computing becomes a strategic concept of iot. the edge computing market reaches several billion usd and grows intensively. in edge computing paradigm, the data can be processed close to, or at the edge of the network. this way greatly reduces the computation and communication load of the network core. moreover, processing data near the sources of data also provides better support for the user privacy. however, an increase in the number of data processing locations will proportionately increase the attack surface. due to limited capacities and resources, an edge node cannot perform too many complex operations. especially for the applications with high real-time requirements, efficiency becomes a crucial issue in secure data analytics. therefore, it is important to get a tradeoff between security and efficiency. we focus on this problem in this paper.

performance analysis of machine learning algorithms in intrusion detection system: a review	 	the rapid growth of technologies not only formulates life easier but also exposes a lot of security issues. with the advancement of the internet over years, the number of attacks over the internet has been increased. intrusion detection system (ids) is one of the supportive layers applicable to information security. ids provide a salubrious environment for business and keeps away from suspicious network activities. recently, machine learning (ml) algorithms are applied in ids in order to identify and classify the security threats. this paper explores the comparative study of various ml algorithms used in ids for several applications such as fog computing, internet of things (iot), big data, smart city, and 5g network. in addition, this work also aims for classifying the intrusions using ml algorithms like linear discriminant analysis (lda), classification and regression trees (cart) and random forest. the work was tested with the kdd-cup dataset and their efficiency was measured and also compared along with the latest researches.

an optimal packet assignment algorithm for multi-level network intrusion detection systems	 	with the outbreaks of recent cyber-attacks, a network intrusion detection system (nids) which can detect and classify abnormal traffic data has drawn a lot of attention. although detection time and accuracy are important factors, there is no work considering both contrastive objectives in an nids. in order to quickly and accurately respond to network threats, intrusion detection algorithms should be implemented on both fog and cloud devices, which have different levels of computing capacity and detection time, in a collaborative manner. therefore, this work proposes a packet assignment algorithm that assigns detection and classification tasks for appropriate processing devices. specifically, we formulate a novel optimization problem that minimizes detection time while achieving accuracy performance and computational constraints. then, an optimal packet assignment algorithm that allocates as many packets as possible to fog devices in order to shorten the detection time is proposed. the experimental results on a state-of-the-art network dataset (unsw-nb15) show that the proposed packet assignment algorithm produces similar performance to the optimal solution with regard to the detection time and accuracy.

machine learning-based intrusion detection system for smart city	 	nowadays, the cloud computing-based internet of things (iot) environment suffers from problems such as rapidly increasing data traffic volume, heterogeneity and latency. one of the typical methods to solve these problems is to utilize fog or edge computing, which distributes storage and computing power concentrated in a cloud computing environment through a distributed model. however, in order to compensate for the disadvantages of this distributed network, mist computing has emerged as the network model closest to internet of things. but, there are thousands of zero-day attacks in the internet environment of things that communicate by various protocols. most of these attacks are small variants of previously known attacks. to effectively prevent such attacks, intrusion detection systems in the environment should be more intelligent. in this paper, in order to solve these problems, we propose an artificial intelligence-based intrusion detection system to effectively protect new or continuously changing attacks to iot in a mist computing environment.

novel three-tier intrusion detection and prevention system in software defined network	 	software defined network (sdn) is a flexible paradigm that provides support for a variety of data-intensive applications with real-world smart internet of things (iot) devices. this emerging architecture updates with the managing ability and network control. still, the benefits are challenging to achieve due to the presence of intruder flow into the network. the research topic of intrusion detection and prevention system (idps) has grasped the attention to reduce the effect of intruders. distributed denial of service (ddos) is a targeted attack that develops malicious traffic is flooded into a particular network device. these intruders also involve even with legitimate network devices, the authenticated device will be compromised to inject malicious traffic. in this paper, we investigate the involvement of intruders in three-tier idps with regard to user validation, packet validation and flow validation. not all the authentication users can be legitimate, since they are compromised, so that the major contribution is to identify all the compromised devices by knee analysis of the packets. routers are the edge devices employed in first tier which is responsible to validate the iot user with rfid tag and encrypted signature. then the authenticated user's packets are submitted into second tier with switches that validates the packets using type-ii fuzzy filtering. then the key features are extracted from packets and they are classified into normal, suspicious and malicious. the mismatched packets are analyzed in controllers which maintain two queues as suspicious and normal. then suspicious queue packets are classified and predicted using deep learning method. the proposed work is experimented in omnet++ environment and the performances are evaluated in terms of intruder detection rate, failure rate, delay, throughput and traffic load.

protÃ©dge: a few-shot ensemble learning approach to software-defined networking-assisted edge security	 	the rise of the internet of things (iot) paradigm has had a significant impact on our lives through many use cases including smart farming, smart homes, and smart healthcare among others. due to the capacity-constrained nature of many iot devices, edge computing has become a significant aid for iot, replacing cloud computing to support the extremely low latency requirements. with the number of smart devices growing exponentially, the large attack surface created by these devices is concerning. software-defined networking (sdn) based architectures come to the rescue of edge-assisted iot environments to achieve enhanced security, and they strongly rely on intelligent decision-making capabilities to act upon the high volume of traffic they control. machine learning-based intelligence is already utilized by these systems with successful results when abundant training data are available; however, most algorithms fail in the lack of sufficient training data. in this article, we propose protÃ©dge, an sdn-based intelligent security architecture for edge-assisted iot networks, which utilizes a few-shot learning classifier, namely prototypical networks, for highly accurate detection of intrusions. we evaluate the performance of the proposed model with the bot-iot data set consisting of real-world iot network flows, as well as an sdn data set modeling an edge-assisted iot environment and the unsw-nb15 data set, and show that the proposed model achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art models in the absence of large amounts of sample attacks. the proposed architecture is promising to achieve intelligent security in future's ubiquitous edge-enabled iot with its low processing overhead and high intrusion detection accuracy.

federated wireless network intrusion detection	 	wi-fi has become the wireless networking standard that allows short- to medium-range device to connect without wires. for the last 20 year, the wi-fi technology has so pervasive that most devices in use today are mobile and connect to the internet through wi-fi. unlike wired network, a wireless network lacks a clear boundary, which leads to significant wi-fi network security concerns, especially because the current security measures are prone to several types of intrusion. to address this problem, machine learning and deep learning methods have been successfully developed to identify network attacks. however, collecting data to develop models is expensive and raises privacy concerns. the goal of this paper is to evaluate a federated learning approach that would alleviate such privacy concerns. this initial work on intrusion detection is performed in a simulated environment. once proven feasible, this process would allow edge devices to collaboratively update global anomaly detection models, without sharing sensitive training data. on a set of tests with the awid intrusion detection data set, we show that our federated approach is effective in terms of classification accuracy, computation cost, as well as communication cost.

home iot intrusion prevention strategy based on edge computing	 	due to the sheer number and heterogeneity of iot devices, it is not possible to secure the iot ecosystem using traditional endpoint and network security solutions. to address the requirements of securing iot devices in edge home networks, this paper proposed a strategy capable of securing the network against most malicious activity in real-time. firstly, we use an edge smart gateway, which is deployed on a raspberry-pi, runs an sdn controller and open vswtich (ovs) to perform traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and traffic filtering. then, with limited resources available on edge gateway, we use a lightweight machine-learning algorithm to classify device to device traffic and identify if there is a network intrusion. the classification model extracts features of network traffic, trained by classic supervised learning method-decision tree j48, then distinguish between benign and malicious traffic patterns observed in the network. simulation results show that the model has high accuracy of intrusion and can effectively ensure security of home iot interactions.

towards security-as-a-service in multi-access edge	 	the prevailing network security measures are often implemented on proprietary appliances that are deployed at fixed network locations with constant capacity. such a rigid deployment is sometimes necessary, but undermines the flexibility of security services in meeting the demands of emerging applications, such as augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and 5g for industry 4.0, which are provoked by the evolution of connected and smart devices, their heterogeneity, and integration with cloud and edge computing infrastructures. to loosen these rigid security deployments, in this paper, we propose a data-centric security-as-a-service (secaas) framework for elastic deployment and provisioning of security services at the multi-access edge computing (mec) infrastructure. in particular, we discuss three security services that are suitable for edge deployment: (i) an intrusion detection and prevention system (idps), (ii) an access control enforcement system (ace), and (iii) a communication anonymization service (ca). we benchmark the common security microservices along with the design and implementation of a proof of concept communication anonymization application.

machine learning for security at the iot edge-a feasibility study	 	benefits of edge computing include reduced latency and bandwidth savings, privacy-by-default and by-design in compliance with new privacy regulations that encourage sharing only the minimal amount of data. this creates a need for processing data locally rather than sending everything to a cloud environment and performing machine learning there. however, most iot edge devices are resource-constrained in comparison and it is not evident whether current machine learning methods are directly employable on iot edge devices. in this paper, we analyze the state-of-the-art machine learning (ml) algorithms for solving security problems (e.g. intrusion detection) at the edge. starting from the characteristics and limitations of edge devices in iot networks, we assess a selected set of commonly used ml algorithms based on four metrics: computation complexity, memory footprint, storage requirement and accuracy. we also compare the suitability of ml algorithms to different cybersecurity problems and discuss the possibility of utilizing these methods for use cases.

fbad: fog-based attack detection for iot healthcare in smart cities	 	the number of zero-day attacks has been exponentially increasing due to a variety of heterogeneous internet of things (iot) protocols. many centralized-based techniques have been introduced to identify malicious activities in iot environments. however, these techniques have suffered including a high latency to satisfy iot requirements. this paper proposes a fog-based attack detection (fbad) framework using an ensemble of online sequential extreme learning machine (eos-elm) for efficiently detecting malicious activities. we indicate a high-level view of the efficient proposed framework for deploying the distributed attack detection technique in fog computing due to high accuracy and low latency, as it is closer to the iot devices at the network edge. furthermore, we compare the performance of our framework with other existing approaches including elm and os-elm. the results of the experiment demonstrate that distributed architecture outperforms centralized architecture in terms of the detection time and classification accuracy.

dns/dane collision-based distributed and dynamic authentication for microservices in iot	 	iot devices provide real-time data to a rich ecosystem of services and applications. the volume of data and the involved subscribe/notify signaling will likely become a challenge also for access and core networks. to alleviate the core of the network, other technologies like fog computing can be used. on the security side, designers of iot low-cost devices and applications often reuse old versions of development frameworks and software components that contain vulnerabilities. many server applications today are designed using microservice architectures where components are easier to update. thus, iot can benefit from deploying microservices in the fog as it offers the required flexibility for the main players of ubiquitous computing: nomadic users. in such deployments, iot devices need the dynamic instantiation of microservices. iot microservices require certificates so they can be accessed securely. thus, every microservice instance may require a newly-created domain name and a certificate. the dns-based authentication of named entities (dane) extension to domain name system security extensions (dnssec) allows linking a certificate to a given domain name. thus, the combination of dnssec and dane provides microservicesâ clients with secure information regarding the domain name, ip address, and server certificate of a given microservice. however, iot microservices may be short-lived since devices can move from one local fog to another, forcing dnssec servers to sign zones whenever new changes occur. considering dnssec and dane were designed to cope with static services, coping with iot dynamic microservice instantiation can throttle the scalability in the fog. to overcome this limitation, this article proposes a solution that modifies the dnssec/dane signature mechanism using chameleon signatures and defining a new soft delegation scheme. chameleon signatures are signatures computed over a chameleon hash, which have a property: a secret trapdoor function can be used to compute collisions to the hash. since the hash is maintained, the signature does not have to be computed again. in the soft delegation schema, dns servers obtain a trapdoor that allows performing changes in a constrained zone without affecting normal dns operation. in this way, a server can receive this soft delegation and modify the dns zone to cope with frequent changes such as microservice dynamic instantiation. changes in the soft delegated zone are much faster and do not require the intervention of the dns primary servers of the zone.

intrusion detection for iot devices based on rf fingerprinting using deep learning	 	internet of things (iot) and 4g/5g wireless networks have added huge number of devices and new services, where commercial-of-the-shelf (cots) iot devices have been deployed extensively. to ensure secure operations of these systems with wireless transmission capabilities, radio frequency (rf) surveillance is important to monitor their activities in rf spectrum and detect unauthorized iot devices. specifically, in order to prevent an adversary from impersonating legitimate users using identical devices from the same manufacturer, unique 'signatures' must be obtained for every individual device in order to uniquely identify each device. in this study, a novel intrusion detection method is proposed to detect unauthorized iot devices using deep learning. the proposed method is based on rf fingerprinting since physical layer based features are device specific and more difficult to impersonate. rf traces are collected from six 'identical' zigbee devices via a usrp based test bed. the traces span a range of signal-to-noise ratio, to ensure robustness of the model. a convolutional neural network is used to extract features from the rf traces, and dimension reduction and de-correlation are performed on the extracted features. the reduced features are then clustered to identify iot devices. we show that the proposed method is able to identify devices that are not observed during training. the results not only highlight the benefit of deep learning based feature extraction, but also show promising prospects for being able to distinguish new devices (classes) that are not observed during training.

low-rate dos attack detection using psd based entropy and machine learning	 	the distributed denial of service attack is one of the most common attacks and it is hard to mitigate, however, it has become more difficult while dealing with the low-rate dos (ldos) attacks. the ldos exploits the vulnerability of tcp congestion-control mechanism by sending malicious traffic at the low constant rate and influence the victim machine. recently, machine learning approaches are applied to detect the complex ddos attacks and improve the efficiency and robustness of the intrusion detection system. in this research, the algorithm is designed to balance the detection rate and its efficiency. the detection algorithm combines the power spectral density (psd) entropy function and support vector machine to detect ldos traffic from normal traffic. in our solution, the detection rate and efficiency are adjustable based on the parameter in the decision algorithm. to have high efficiency, the detection method will always detect the attacks by calculating psd-entropy first and compare it with the two adaptive thresholds. the thresholds can efficiently filter nearly 19% of the samples with a high detection rate. to minimize the computational cost and look only for the patterns that are most relevant for detection, support vector machine based machine learning model is applied to learn the traffic pattern and select appropriate features for detection algorithm. the experimental results show that the proposed approach can detect 99.19% of the ldos attacks and has an o (n log n) time complexity in the best case.

vproval: introspection based process validation for detecting malware in kvm-based cloud environment	 	in the modern era of computing, cloud security is of paramount importance. most of the research mainly focused on in-virtual machine (vm) security techniques for detecting malware affecting virtual domains running in the cloud. in-vm security techniques are deployed inside the vm and hence they are very much prone to subversion attacks. in this paper, an-vm monitoring approach based on introspection, called vproval, is proposed. the vproval is designed to detect the hidden processes and rootkits that disable the security tool, running in the monitored vm in kernel vm (kvm)-based cloud environment. it performs the malware detection from outside the vm at the kvm-layer and hence more robust to attacks. the introspection technique used is to extract the low-level details of a running vm from hypervisor by viewing its memory, trapping on hardware events, and accessing the vcpu registers. a preliminary analysis has been performed and the approach is found to be promising.

scalable poisoning against regression-type edge computing applications via an approximate optimization strategy	 	as the machine learning technology is being widely used in next-generation networks aided by edge computing, its security is of great concern for network maintenance and management. on the other hand, intelligent data processing techniques for enhancing the performance of next-generation networks are mainly used to reinforce resource management, control and optimization. therefore, compared to learning a classifier for other application scenarios (e.g., pattern recognition, network intrusion detection, image identification, etc.), learning a good regressor via machine learning is more valuable for edge computing applications in next-generation networks. hence, we revisit the security of polynomial regression learning in this paper and propose a scalable poisoning method against regression-type edge computing applications via an approximate optimization strategy. specifically, we first analyze the existing gradientbased optimization poisoning method (called optp) against linear regression model. then, we extend the method and give a formal description of poisoning against polynomial regression with order greater than one. after that, we propose a greedy optimization strategy to obtain good adversarial examples for compromising polynomial regression-type applications. finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed poisoning method by applying it to attack against two synthetic data sets and three public data sets from three different application scenarios.

hmm-based secure framework for optical fog devices in the optical fog/cloud network	 	in the present optical fog/cloud computing environment, optical line terminals and optical network units are used as the most promising optical fog devices (ofds). the inherent characteristics of fog computing provide certain granted privileges to the attacker to hack devices and make them malicious. also, existing security solutions generate false alarms that affect the performance of the underlying network. in this paper, a secure framework is proposed that not only predicts the malicious ofds but also reduces false alarms. hidden markov model and intrusion detection system are used to detect the malicious one by computing the probability of shifting (pos) and then shift it to the virtual honeypot which is kept hidden by deploying it at the optical fog layer. in addition, it also reduces the generation of false alarm and logs all malicious activities for further analysis. in the experiment section, python is used to validate the proposed framework. further, hmm is simulated and tested in the matlab to reduce the false alarm rate. results show that the proposed framework effectively reduces the false alarms and detects the malicious one and then shifts it onto the virtual honeypot efficiently.

fog-cloud distributed intrusion detection and cooperation	 	cloud computing is becoming a promoted technology. over the recent years, it has rapidly grown and its adoption is more and more increasing. many enterprizes and organizations have immigrated their data to the cloud. however, the security of this technology is considered a serious barrier to guarantee the organizations' trust on it. therefore, intrusion detection has been set as the best solution to secure the cloud platform. thus, many research studies have been developed for the aim to create an effective and performing intrusion detection system suitable for the cloud environment. in this paper, we propose a new approach for cloud environmentâbased multilevel cooperation in terms of intrusion detection. it is based on the cooperation and the correlation between fog nodes at the beginning and then between fog and cloud technology. we also evaluate the performance and the efficiency of this proposed prototype in terms of detection rates and detection response to make real-time detection in the whole cloud platform. the results show that the proposed architecture introduces low false positive rate compared to the existing hybrid intrusion detection approach in cloud computing (hidcc) framework.

a lightweight ddos attack mitigation system within the isp domain utilising self-organizing map	 	disruption precipitated by distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks has escalated drastically in recent years. this is due to the deployment of faster network access technologies, innovative network reliant applications and leading edge devices like smart phones, tablets and internet of things (iot). applications running on these devices are increasing the dependency of high speed network services. nonetheless, the main objective of ddos attacks are to deprive legitimate users of network services by exhausting a victimâs bandwidth or hardware resources. most current approaches offer centralized detection and mitigation. however, few proposals focus on deploying ddos defense and mitigation systems within the ispâs domain, which has the potential to provide scalable and distributed solutions for these attacks. this paper presents a lightweight ddos attack mitigation system utilising self-organizing map algorithm to classify near real time netflow data collected by the isp.

passive real-time asset inventory tracking and security monitoring of grid-edge devices	 	among the many cybersecurity challenges associated with protecting the critical infrastructure power grid, two of the most challenging are maintaining an accurate asset inventory list and performing security monitoring of devices at the grid's edge. not only are these capabilities fundamental to avoid regulatory fines upward of a million a day, they also help ensure the overall security, safety, and reliability of the grid. often thought of as mutually exclusive, this paper shows that through advanced passive security monitoring, asset owners can maintain, in real-time, an accurate and up-to-date asset inventory list while also protecting the grid's edge from cyber threats. by stepping through the different use-cases for passive network security monitoring, the paper demonstrates how asset owners can reach a higher return on their investment in such a way that is technically, economically, and operationally feasible.

a novel framework for collaborative intrusion detection for m2m networks	 	the proliferation of sensor devices has introduced exciting possibilities such as the internet of things (iot). machine to machine (m2m) communication underpins efficient interactions within such infrastructures. the resource constraints and ad-hoc nature of these networks have significant implications for security in general and with respect to intrusion detection in particular. consequently, contemporary solutions mandating a stable infrastructure are inadequate to fulfill these defining characteristics of m2m networks. in this paper, we present colide (collaborative intrusion detection engine) a novel framework for effective intrusion detection in the m2m networks without incurring high energy and communication cost on the participating host and edge nodes. the framework is envisioned to address challenges such as flexibility, resource constraints, and the collaborative nature of the m2m networks. the paper presents a detailed system description along with its formal and empirical evaluation using contiki os. our evaluation for different communication scenarios demonstrates that the proposed approach has limited overhead in terms of energy utilization and memory consumption.

fog-assisted sdn controlled framework for enduring anomaly detection in an iot network	 	extensive adoption of intelligent devices with ubiquitous connectivity has increased internet of things (iot) traffic tremendously. the smart devices promise to improve human life through improved safety and security through the implementation of intelligent transportation systems, optimization of power grids, and applications in human health. devices produce a large amount of data for analytic applications running inside a cloud infrastructure. unlike core networks, the main objective of an attack on an iot network is to disrupt the availability of iot data for the applications by overwhelming devices with information requests. detection of such an attack cannot be done either in the cloud where the analytical application runs nor on the iot device itself due to its limited computational resources. furthermore, the standard networking paradigm does not provide an easy way to instrument and control networking nodes, for an effective mitigation of identified threats. in this paper, we propose a fog-assisted software defined networking (sdn) driven intrusion detection/prevention system (idps) for iot networks. a collocated fog computational arrangement with iot network equips proposed idps for timely identification of various attack models in near real time for effective neutralization of threats using sdn control. we have found our approach more effective from traditional techniques of intrusion detection in the iot network.

leveraging lstm networks for attack detection in fog-to-things communications	 	the evolution and sophistication of cyber-attacks need resilient and evolving cybersecurity schemes. as an emerging technology, the internet of things (iot) inherits cyber-attacks and threats from the it environment despite the existence of a layered defensive security mechanism. the extension of the digital world to the physical environment of iot brings unseen attacks that require a novel lightweight and distributed attack detection mechanism due to their architecture and resource constraints. architecturally, fog nodes can be leveraged to offload security functions from iot and the cloud to mitigate the resource limitation issues of iot and scalability bottlenecks of the cloud. classical machine learning algorithms have been extensively used for intrusion detection, although scalability, feature engineering efforts, and accuracy have hindered their penetration into the security market. these shortcomings could be mitigated using the deep learning approach as it has been successful in big data fields. apart from eliminating the need to craft features manually, deep learning is resilient against morphing attacks with high detection accuracy. this article proposes an lstm network for distributed cyber-attack detection in fog-to-things communication. we identify and analyze critical attacks and threats targeting iot devices, especially attacks exploiting vulnerabilities of wireless communications. the conducted experiments on two scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of deeper models over traditional machine learning models.

a privacy-preserving framework for collaborative intrusion detection networks through fog computing	 	nowadays, cyber threats (e.g., intrusions) are distributed across various networks with the dispersed networking resources. intrusion detection systems (idss) have already become an essential solution to defend against a large amount of attacks. with the development of cloud computing, a modern ids is able to implement more complicated detection algorithms by offloading the expensive operations such as the process of signature matching to the cloud (i.e., utilizing computing resources from the cloud). however, during the detection process, no party wants to disclose their own data especially sensitive information to others for privacy concerns, even to the cloud side. for this sake, privacy-preserving technology has been applied to idss, while it still lacks of proper solutions for a collaborative intrusion detection network (cidn) due to geographical distribution. a cidn enables a set of dispersed ids nodes to exchange required information. with the advent of fog computing, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving framework for collaborative networks based on fog devices. our study shows that the proposed framework can help reduce the workload on cloudâs side.

new approaches to mitigation of malicious traffic in voip networks	 	voice over ip (voip) telephony is becoming widespread in use, and is often integrated into computer networks. because of this, malicious software threatens voip systems in the same way that traditional computer systems have been attacked by viruses, worms, and other automated agents. voip networks are a challenge to secure against such malware as much of the network intelligence is focused on the edge devices and access environment. this paper describes the design and implementation of a novel voip security architecture in which evaluation of, and mitigation against, malicious traffic is demonstrated by the use of virtual machines to emulate vulnerable clients and servers through the use of apparent attack vectors. this new architecture, which is part of an ongoing research project, establishes interaction between the voip backend and the end users, thus providing information about ongoing and unknown attacks to users.	denial of service (dos); event correlation; intrusion detection system (ids); malware; security architecture; session initiation protocol (sip); voice over ip (voip)	denial of service; event correlation; intrusion detection systems; malwares; security architecture; session initiation protocol; voice over ip; computer crime; industrial management; network architecture; security of data; software agents; viruses; voice/data communication systems; internet telephony
neural methods based on modified reputation rules for detection and identification of intrusion attacks in wireless ad hoc sensor networks	 	determining methods to secure the process of data fusion against attacks by compromised nodes in wireless sensor networks (wsns) and to quantify the uncertainty that may exist in the aggregation results is a critical issue in mitigating the effects of intrusion attacks. published research has introduced the concept of the trustworthiness (reputation) of a single sensor node. reputation is evaluated using an information-theoretic concept, the kullback- leibler (kl) distance. reputation is added to the set of security features. in data aggregation, an opinion, a metric of the degree of belief, is generated to represent the uncertainty in the aggregation result. as aggregate information is disseminated along routes to the sink node(s), its corresponding opinion is propagated and regulated by josang's belief model. by applying subjective logic on the opinion to manage trust propagation, the uncertainty inherent in aggregation results can be quantified for use in decision making. the concepts of reputation and opinion are modified to allow their application to a class of dynamic wsns. using reputation as a factor in determining interim aggregate information is equivalent to implementation of a reputation-based security filter at each processing stage of data fusion, thereby improving the intrusion detection and identification results based on unsupervised techniques. in particular, the reputation-based version of the probabilistic neural network (pnn) learns the signature of normal network traffic with the random probability weights normally used in the pnn replaced by the trust-based quantified reputations of sensor data or subsequent aggregation results generated by the sequential implementation of a version of josang's belief model. a two-stage, intrusion detection and identification algorithm is implemented to overcome the problems of large sensor data loads and resource restrictions in wsns. performance of the twostage algorithm is assessed in simulations of wsn scenarios with multiple sensors at edge nodes for known intrusion attacks. simulation results show improved robustness of the two-stage design based on reputation-based nns to intrusion anomalies from compromised nodes and external intrusion attacks.

securing ims against novel threats	 	fixed mobile convergence (fmc) based on the 3gpp ip multimedia subsystem (ims) is considered one of the most important communication technologies of this decade. yet this all-ip-based network technology brings about the growing danger of security vulnerabilities in communication and data services. protecting ims infrastructure servers against malicious exploits poses a major challenge due to the huge number of systems that may be affected. we approach this problem by proposing an architecture for an autonomous and self-sufficient monitoring and protection system for devices and infrastructure inspired by network intrusion detection techniques. the crucial feature of our system is a signature-less detection of abnormal events and zero-day attacks. these attacks may be hidden in a single message or spread across a sequence of messages. anomalies identified at any of the network domain's ingresses can be further analyzed for discriminative patterns that can be immediately distributed to all edge nodes in the network domain.

a resource efficient content inspection system for next generation smart nics	 	the aggregate power consumption of the internet is increasing at an alarming rate, due in part to the rapid increase in the number of connected edge devices such as desktop pcs. despite being left idle 75% of the time, 90% of pcs have their power management features disabled. consequently, much recent research has focused on reducing power consumption of internet edge devices. one such method for reducing pc power consumption is by augmenting the network interface card (nic) with enhanced processing capabilities. these capabilities pave the way for green computing by allowing the pc to transition to a low-power sleep state while the nic responds to network traffic on behalf of the pc - a technique known as power proxying. however, such a smart-nic (snic) requires specialized low-power, resource-constrained processing, and architectural features in order to realize such capabilities. in this paper, we present a nic-based packet content inspection system for power proxying and network intrusion detection. we use a novel partitioned tcam technique that results in 87% energy savings and a 62% lower energy-delay product than existing non-partitioned router-based techniques, thus making our technique highly suitable for snic-based deployment.

eclipse attacks on overlay networks: threats and defenses	 	"overlay networks are widely used to deploy functionality at edge nodes without changing network routers. each node in an overlay network maintains connections with a number of peers, forming a graph upon which a distributed application or service is implemented. in an ""eclipse"" attack, a set of malicious, colluding overlay nodes arranges for a correct node to peer only with members of the coalition. if successful, the attacker can mediate most or all communication to and from the victim. furthermore, by supplying biased neighbor information during normal overlay maintenance, a modest number of malicious nodes can eclipse a large number of correct victim nodes. this paper studies the impact of eclipse attacks on structured overlays and shows the limitations of known defenses. we then present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new defense, in which nodes anonymously audit each other's connectivity. the key observation is that a node that mounts an eclipse attack must have a higher than average node degree. we show that enforcing a node degree limit by auditing is an effective defense against eclipse attacks. furthermore, unlike most existing defenses, our defense leaves flexibility in the selection of neighboring nodes, thus permitting important overlay optimizations like proximity neighbor selection (pns).

development of an integrated solution for intrusion detection: a model based on data correlation	 	this work describes a solution for intrusion detection that presents an improved operational efficacy - both in terms of performance as well as volume of processed data - reducing at the same time the number of false negative and false positive results. for that purpose we correlate the data collected by the intrusion detection system with other data sources, such as events that are reported by interfacing equipment (edge devices) as well as other agents considered crucial for this purpose such as vulnerability detection solutions. as part of the proposed solution the data is collected in a relational data base system, to facilitate data correlation, as well as making it available through an easy to use web interface. additionally, the system interacts with the network managers, in response to pre-defined triggers using a unified messaging platform that uses tools capable of processing e-mails, text messages and also an instant messaging tool based of the xmpp protocol.
