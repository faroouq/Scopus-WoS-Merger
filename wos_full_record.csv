J	Roman, R; Lopez, J; Mambo, M				Roman, Rodrigo; Lopez, Javier; Mambo, Masahiro			Mobile edge computing, Fog et al.: A survey and analysis of security threats and challenges	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Security; Privacy; Cloud computing; Fog computing; Mobile edge computing; Mobile cloud computing	INTRUSION DETECTION; CLOUD; PRIVACY; AUTHENTICATION; NETWORKS; INTERNET; ISSUES	For various reasons, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet certain requirements (e.g. low latency and jitter, context awareness, mobility support) that are crucial for several applications (e.g. vehicular networks, augmented reality). To fulfill these requirements, various paradigms, such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and mobile cloud computing, have emerged in recent years. While these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalized; no synergies have been explored. This is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others. The main goal of this study is to holistically analyze the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration. In our results, we will show that all edge paradigms should consider the advances in other paradigms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the characteristics of fog computing arise new security and privacy challenges. The existing security and privacy measurements for cloud computing cannot be directly applied to the fog computing due to its features, such as mobility, heterogeneity, and large-scale geo-distribution. This paper provides an overview of existing security and privacy concerns, particularly for the fog computing. Afterward, this survey highlights ongoing research effort, open challenges, and research trends in privacy and security issues for fog computing.

A Comprehensive Study of Security of Internet-of-Things	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTING			English	Article						Availability; confidentiality; countermeasures; integrity; Internet of Things; privacy; security; vulnerabilities	INTRUSION DETECTION; ATTACKS; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; IOT	Internet of Things (IoT), also referred to as the Internet of Objects, is envisioned as a transformative approach for providing numerous services. Compact smart devices constitute an essential part of IoT. They range widely in use, size, energy capacity, and computation power. However, the integration of these smart things into the standard Internet introduces several security challenges because the majority of Internet technologies and communication protocols were not designed to support IoT. Moreover, commercialization of IoT has led to public security concerns, including personal privacy issues, threat of cyber attacks, and organized crime. In order to provide a guideline for those who want to investigate IoT security and contribute to its improvement, this survey attempts to provide a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities and countermeasures against them on the edge-side layer of IoT, which consists of three levels: (i) edge nodes, (ii) communication, and (iii) edge computing. To achieve this goal, we first briefly describe three widely-known IoT reference models and define security in the context of IoT. Second, we discuss the possible applications of IoT and potential motivations of the attackers who target this new paradigm. Third, we discuss different attacks and threats. Fourth, we describe possible countermeasures against these attacks. Finally, we introduce two emerging security challenges not yet explained in detail in previous literature.

Accounting for the features and constraints of IoT devices, traditional security countermeasures can be inefficient in dynamic IoT environments. In this vein, the advantages introduced by software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) have the potential to reshape the landscape of cybersecurity for IoT systems. To this aim, we provide a comprehensive analysis of security features introduced by NFV and SDN, describing the manifold strategies able to monitor, protect, and react to IoT security threats. We also present lessons learned in the adoption of SDN/NFV-based protection approaches in IoT environments, comparing them with conventional security countermeasures. Finally, we deeply discuss the open challenges related to emerging SDN- and NFV-based security mechanisms, aiming to provide promising directives to conduct future research in this fervent area.

Researchers and Information Technology (IT) organizations have explored many solutions to protect systems from unauthenticated device attacks (known as outside device attacks). Fog computing uses network devices (e.g. router, switch and hub) for latency-aware processing of collected data using IoT. Then, identification of malicious edge device is one of the critical activities in data security of fog computing environment. Preventing attacks from malicious edge devices in fog computing environment is more difficult because they have certain granted privileges to use and process the data. In this paper, proposed cybersecurity framework uses three technologies which are Markov model, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Virtual Honeypot Device (VHD) to identify malicious edge device in fog computing environment. A two stage hidden Markov model is used to effectively categorize edge devices in four different levels. VHD is designed to store and maintain log repository of all identified malicious devices which assists the system to defend itself from any unknown attacks in the future. Proposed cybersecurity framework is tested with real attacks in virtual environment created using OpenStack and Microsoft Azure. Results indicated that proposed cybersecurity framework is successful in identifying the malicious device as well as reducing the false IDS alarm rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The integration of IoT with Cloud and Fog Computing can bring not only the required computational power and storage capacity, but they enable IoT services to be pervasive, cost-effective, and can be accessed from anywhere using any device (mobile or stationary). However, IoT infrastructures and services will introduce grand security challenges due to the significant increase in the attack surface, complexity, heterogeneity and number of resources. In this paper, we present an IoT security framework for smart infrastructures such as Smart Homes (SH) and smart buildings (SB). We also present a general threat model that can be used to develop a security protection methodology for IoT services against cyber-attacks (known or unknown). Additionally, we show that Anomaly Behavior Analysis (ABA) Intrusion Detection System (ABA-IDS) can detect and classify a wide range of attacks against IoT sensors.

The rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today's society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. In today's hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. As the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. This new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. This paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. After introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. In addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled IoT systems is presented. Then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled IoT are given. We also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. In this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based IoT systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations.

Edge Computing-Based Security Framework for Big Data Analytics in VANETs	IEEE NETWORK			English	Article							INTRUSION DETECTION; ENVIRONMENT	With the exponential growth of technologies such as loT, edge computing, and 5G, a tremendous amount of structured and unstructured data is being generated from different applications in the smart citiy environment in recent years. Thus, there is a need to develop sophisticated techniques that can efficiently process such huge volumes of data. One of the important components of smart cities, ITS, has led to many applications, including surveillance, infotainment, real-time traffic monitoring, and so on. However, its security, performance, and availability are major concerns facing the research community. The existing solutions, such as cellular networks, RSUs, and mobile cloud computing, are far from perfect because these are highly dependent on centralized architecture and bear the cost of additional infrastructure deployment Also, the conventional methods of data processing are not capable of handling dynamic and scalable data efficiently. To mitigate these issues, this article proposes an advanced vehicular communication technique where RSUs are proposed to be replaced by edge computing platforms. Then secure V2V and V2E communication is designed using the Quotient filter, a probabilistic data structure. In summary, a smart security framework for VANETs equipped with edge computing nodes and 5G technology has been designed to enhance the capabilities of communication and computation in the modern smart city environment. It has been experimentally demonstrated that use of edge nodes as an intermediate interface between vehicle and cloud reduces access latency and avoids congestion in the backbone network, which allows quick decisions to be made based on the traffic scenario in the geographical location of the vehicles. The proposed scheme outperforms the conventional vehicular models by providing an energy-efficient secure system with minimum delay.

Especially, as the core and enable technologies will be associated with 5G network, the confidential information will move at all layers in future wireless systems. Several incidents revealed that the hazard encountered by an infected wireless network, not only affects the security and privacy concerns, but also impedes the complex dynamics of the communications ecosystem. Consequently, the complexity and strength of security attacks have increased in the recent past making the detection or prevention of sabotage a global challenge. From the security and privacy perspectives, this paper presents a comprehensive detail on the core and enabling technologies, which are used to build the 5G security model; network softwarization security, PHY (Physical) layer security and 5G privacy concerns, among others. Additionally, the paper includes discussion on security monitoring and management of 5G networks. This paper also evaluates the related security measures and standards of core 5G technologies by resorting to different standardization bodies and provide a brief overview of 5G standardization security forces. Furthermore, the key projects of international significance, in line with the security concerns of 5G and beyond are also presented.

Due to the resources being limited, fog nodes/MEC hosts are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Lightweight intrusion detection system (IDS) is a key technique to solve the problem. Because extreme learning machine (ELM) has the characteristics of fast training speed and good generalization ability, we present a new lightweight IDS called sample selected extreme learning machine (SS-ELM). The reason why we propose sample selected extreme learning machine is that fog nodes/MEC hosts do not have the ability to store extremely large amounts of training data sets. Accordingly, they are stored, computed, and sampled by the cloud servers. Then, the selected sample is given to the fog nodes/MEC hosts for training. This design can bring down the training time and increase the detection accuracy. Experimental simulation verifies that SS-ELM performs well in intrusion detection in terms of accuracy, training time, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) value.

This article envisions a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) solution that enables node collaboration among IoT devices to provide reliable and secure communication between devices and the fog layer on one hand, and the fog layer and the cloud layer on the other hand. The solution assumes that collaboration is determined based on nodes' resource capabilities and cooperation willingness. Resource capabilities are defined using ontologies, while willingness to cooperate is described using a three-factor node criteria, namely: nature, attitude and awareness. A learning method is adopted to identify candidates for the service composition and delivery process. We show that the system does not require extensive training for services to be delivered correct and accurate. The proposed solution reduces the amount of unnecessary traffic flow to and from the edge, by relying on node-to-node communication protocols. Communication to the fog and cloud layers is used for more data and computing-extensive applications, hence, ensuring secure communication protocols to the cloud. Preliminary simulations are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of adapting the proposed framework to achieve smart city sustainability through service reliability and security. Results show that the proposed solution outperforms other semi-cooperative and non-cooperative service composition techniques in terms of efficient service delivery and composition delay, service hit ratio, and suspicious node identification.

To this end, we propose a malware detection infrastructure realized by an intrusion detection system (IDS) with cloud and fog computing to overcome the IDS deployment problem in smart objects due to their limited resources and heterogeneous subnetworks. We then employ a signaling game to disclose interactions between smart objects and the corresponding fog node because of malware uncertainty in smart objects. To minimize privacy leakage of smart objects, we also develop optimal strategies that maximize malware detection probability by theoretically computing the perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the game. Moreover, we analyze the factors influencing the optimal probability of a malicious smart object diffusing malware, and factors influencing the performance of a fog node in determining an infected smart object. Finally, we present a framework to demonstrate a potential and practical application of suppressing malware diffusion in IoT networks.

The integration of IoT with fog and cloud computing not only brings the computational requirements but also enables IoT services to be pervasive, cost-effective, and accessible from anywhere and at anytime. In any IoT application, sensors are indispensable to bring the physical world into the digital world that can be implemented by leveraging fog computing. However, IoT sensors will introduce major security challenges as they contribute to a significant increase in the IoT attack surface. In this paper, we present a methodology to develop an intrusion detection system on the basis of anomaly behavior analysis to detect when a sensor has been compromised and used to provide misinformation. Our preliminary experimental results show that our approach can accurately authenticate sensors on the basis of their behavior and can detect known and unknown sensor attacks with high detection rate and low false alarms.

Industry 4.0 includes the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing paradigms for developing smart systems, smart homes, and smart cities. Given Industry 4.0 is comprised sensor fields, actuators, fog and cloud processing paradigms, and network systems, designing a secure architecture faces two major challenges: handling heterogeneous sources at scale and maintaining security over a large, disparate, data-driven system that interacts with the physical environment. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new threat intelligence scheme that models the dynamic interactions of industry 4.0 components including physical and network systems. The scheme consists of two components: a smart management module and a threat intelligence module. The smart data management module handles heterogeneous data sources, one of the foundational requirements for interacting with an Industry 4.0 system. This includes data to and from sensors, actuators, in addition to other forms of network traffic. The proposed threat intelligence technique is designed based on beta mixture-hidden Markov models (MHMMs) for discovering anomalous activities against both physical and network systems. The scheme is evaluated on two well-known datasets: the CPS dataset of sensors and actuators and the UNSW-NB15 dataset of network traffic. The results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms five peer mechanisms, suggesting its effectiveness as a viable deployment methodology in real-Industry 4.0 systems.

Many researchers have dealt with this problem and have proposed many methods for detecting different kinds of intrusions such as selective forwarding, which is a serious attack that may obstruct communications in WSNs. However, as the applications of mobile computing, vehicular networks, and internet of things (IoT) are spreading immensely, selective forwarding detection in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) has become a key demand. This paper introduces the problem of selective forwarding in MWSNs, and discusses how available techniques for mitigation this problem in WSNs are not applicable in handling the problem in MWSNs due to sensors mobility. Therefore, the paper proposes a model that provides a global monitoring capability for tracing moving sensors and detecting malicious ones. The model leverages the infrastructure of Fog Computing to achieve this purpose. Furthermore, the paper provides a complete algorithm, a comprehensive discussion and experiments that show the correctness and importance of the proposed approach.

The fog is a decentralized platform capable of operating and processing data locally and can be installed in heterogeneous hardware which makes it ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are an integral part of any security system for fog and IoT networks to ensure the quality of service. Due to the resource limitations of fog and IoT devices, lightweight IDS is highly desirable. In this paper, we present a lightweight IDS based on a vector space representation using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. We evaluated the presented IDS against the Australian Defense Force Academy Linux Dataset (ADFA-LD) and Australian Defense Force Academy Windows Dataset (ADFA-WD), which are new generation system calls datasets that contain exploits and attacks on various applications. The simulation shows that by using a single hidden layer and a small number of nodes, we are able to achieve a 94% Accuracy, 95% Recall, and 92% F1-Measure in ADFA-LD and 74% Accuracy, 74% Recall, and 74% F1-Measure in ADFA-WD.

With rapidly growing number of connected devices in IoT, the scope for cyber-attack also increases exponentially. Therefore an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) is needed to efficiently detect the attack at faster rate in highly scalable and dynamic IoT environment. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique is proposed based on fog computing using Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) which can intelligently interpret the attacks from the IoT traffic. In the proposed system, the existing centralized cloud intelligence in detecting the attack is distributed to local fog nodes to detect the attack at faster rate for IoT application.

In this paper, we propose an adversarial statistical learning mechanism for anomaly detection, outlier Dirichlet mixture-based ADS (ODM-ADS), which has three new capabilities. First, it can self-adapt against data poisoning attacks that inject malicious instances in the training phase for disrupting the learning process. Second, it establishes a statistical legitimate profile and considers variations from the baseline of the profile as anomalies using a proposed outlier function. Third, to deal with dynamic and large-scale networks such as Internet of Things and cloud and fog computing, we suggest a framework for deploying the mechanism as Software as a Service in the fog nodes. The fog enables the proposed mechanism to concurrently process streaming data at the edge of the network. The ODM-ADS mechanism is evaluated using both NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets, whose findings indicate that ODM-ADS outperforms seven other peer algorithms in terms of accuracy, detection rates, false positive rates, and computational time.

Modern IDSs overcome the limitation of hardware processing power by offloading computation extensive operations such as signature matching to the cloud. Moreover, in order to prevent the rapid spread of transmissible cyber threats, collaborative intrusion detection schemes are widely deployed to allow distributed IDS nodes to exchange information with each other. However, no party wants to disclose their own data during the detection process, especially sensitive user data to others, even the cloud providers for privacy concerns. In this background, privacy-preserving technology has been researched in the field of intrusion detection, whereas a collaborative intrusion detection network (CIDN) environment still lacks of appropriate solutions due to its geographical distribution. With the advent of fog computing, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving framework for signature based intrusion detection in a distributed network based on fog devices. The results in both simulated and real environments demonstrate that our proposed framework can help reserve the privacy of shared data, reduce the workload on the cloud side, and offer less detection delay as compared to similar approaches.

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks by intruders on fog nodes will cause system resources to be illegally appropriate. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a powerful technology that can be used to resist DDoS attacks. In our previous research, we have proposed a fog computing intrusion detection system (FC-IDS) framework. In this paper, we mainly analyze and model the DDoS attacks under the framework of FC-IDS. We propose a hypergraph clustering model based on Apriori algorithm. This model can effectively describe the association between fog nodes which are suffering from the threat of DDoS. Through simulation, we verify that the resource utilization rate of the system can be effectively promoted through the DDoS association analysis.

As the Internet becomes more deeply integrated into our business operations through IoT platform, the desire for reliable and efficient connections increases as well. Fog and Cloud security is a topical issue associated with every data storage, managing or processing paradigm. Attacks once occurred, have ineradicable and disastrous effects on the development of IoT, Fog, Cloud computing. Therefore, many security systems/models have been proposed and/or implemented for the sake of Fog security. Intrusion detection systems are one of the premier choices especially ones that designed using artificial intelligence. In our paper, we presented an artificially full-automated intrusion detection system for Fog security against cyber-attacks. The proposed model uses multi-layered of recurrent neural networks designed to be implemented for Fog computing security that is very close to the end-users and IoT devices. We demonstrated our proposed model using a balanced version of the challenging dataset: NSL-KDD. The performance of our model was measured using a variety of typical metrics, and we add two additional metrics: Mathew correlation and Cohen's Kappa coefficients for deeper insight. where the experimental results and simulations proved the stability and robustness of the proposed model in terms of a variety of performance metrics.

Mobile security suites exist to defend devices against malware and other intrusions. However, they require extensive resources not continuously available on mobile terminals, hence affecting their relevance, efficiency and sustainability. In this paper, we address the aforementioned problem while taking into account the devices limited resources such as energy and CPU usage as well as the mobile connectivity and latency. In this context, we propose an ad-hoc mobile edge cloud that takes advantage of Wi-Fi Direct as means of achieving connectivity, sharing resources, and integrating security services among nearby mobile devices. The proposed scheme embeds a multi-objective resource-aware optimization model and genetic-based solution that provide smart offloading decision based on dynamic profiling of contextual and statistical data from the ad-hoc mobile edge cloud devices. The carried experiments illustrate the relevance and efficiency of exchanging security services while maintaining their sustainability with or without the availability of Internet connection. Moreover, the results provide optimal offloading decision and distribution of security services while significantly reducing energy consumption, execution time, and number of selected computational nodes without sacrificing security.

RAD-EI: A routing attack detection scheme for edge-based Internet of Things environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						edge computing; intrusion detection; IoT; NS2; routing attack; security	USER AUTHENTICATION SCHEME; WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; INTRUSION DETECTION; ANOMALY DETECTION; SINKHOLE ATTACKS; SECURITY; IOT; PERFORMANCE	Internet of Things (IoT) offers various types of application services in different domains, such as smart infrastructure, health-care, critical infrastructure, and intelligent transportation system. The name edge computing signifies a corner or edge in a network at which traffic enters or exits from the network. In edge computing, the data analysis task happens very close to the IoT smart sensors and devices. Edge computing can also speed up the analysis process, which allows decision makers to take action within a short duration of time. However, edge-based IoT environment has several security and privacy issues similar to those for the cloud-based IoT environment. Various types of attacks, such as replay, man-in-the middle, impersonation, password guessing, routing attack, and other denial of service attacks may be possible in edge-based IoT environment. The routing attacker nodes have the capability to deviate and disrupt the normal flow of traffic. These malicious nodes do not send packets (messages) to the edge node and only send packets to its neighbor collaborator attacker nodes. Therefore, in the presence of such kind of routing attack, edge node does not get the information or sometimes it gets the partial information. This further affects the overall performance of communication of edge-based IoT environment. In the presence of such an attack, the throughput of the network decreases, end-to-end delay increases, packet delivery ratio decreases, and other parameters also get affected. Consequently, it is important to provide solution for such kind of attack. In this paper, we design an intrusion detection scheme for the detection of routing attack in edge-based IoT environment called as RAD-EI. We simulate RAD-EI using the widely used NS2 simulator to measure different network parameters. Furthermore, we provide the security analysis of RAD-EI to prove its resilience against routing attacks. RAD-EI accomplishes around 95.0% detection rate and 1.23% false positive rate that are notably better than other related existing schemes. In addition, RAD-EI is efficient in terms of computation and communication costs. As a result, RAD-EI is a good match for some critical and sensitive applications, such as smart security and surveillance system.

However, false alarms are one challenging issue for such systems, which would significantly degrade the effectiveness of detection and greatly increase the burden of analysis. To solve this problem, building an intelligent false alarm filter using machine learning classifiers is considered as one promising solution, where an appropriate algorithm can be selected in an adaptive way in order to maintain the filtration accuracy. By means of cloud computing, the task of adaptive algorithm selection can be offloaded to the cloud, whereas it could cause communication delay and increase additional burden. In this work, motivated by the advent of edge computing, we propose a framework to improve the intelligent false alarm reduction for DIDS based on edge computing devices. Our framework can provide energy efficiency as the data can be processed at the edge for shorter response time. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework can help reduce the workload for the central server and the delay as compared to the similar studies.

This paper focuses on addressing a transversal detection system to be able to protect at the same time, infrastructures, tenants and 5G users in both edge and core network segments of the 5G multi-tenant infrastructures. A novel approach which significantly extends the capabilities of a commonly used IDS, to accurately identify attacking nodes in a 5G network, regardless of multiple network traffic encapsulations, has been proposed in this paper. The proposed approach is suitable to be deployed in almost all 5G network segments including the Mobile Edge Computing. Both architectural design and data models are described in this contribution. Empirical experiments have been carried out a realistic 5G multi-tenant infrastructures to intensively validate the design of the proposed approach regarding scalability and flexibility.

These objects increasingly interact with machine learning applications that perform feature extraction and model inference in the cloud. However, this approach poses several challenges due to latency, privacy, and dependency on network connectivity between data producers and consumers. To alleviate these limitations, computation should be moved as much as possible towards the IoT edge, that is on gateways, if not directly on data producers. In this paper, we propose a design framework for smart audio sensors able to record and pre-process raw audio streams, before wirelessly transmitting the computed audio features to a modular IoT gateway. In this paper, an anomaly detection algorithm executed as a micro-service is capable of analyzing the received features, hence detecting audio anomalies in real-time. First, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, we deployed a real smart environment showcase. More in detail, we adopted two different anomaly detection algorithms, namely Elliptic Envelope and Isolation Forest, that were purposely trained and deployed on an affordable IoT gateway to detect anomalous sound events happening in an office environment. Then, we numerically compared both the deployments, in terms of end-to-end latency and gateway CPU load, also deriving some ideal capacity bounds.

Due to its characteristics (e.g., geo-location and constrained resource), fog computing is subject to a broad range of security threats. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an essential security technology to deal with the security threats in fog computing. We have introduced a fog computing IDS (FC-IDS) framework in our previous work. In this paper, we study the optimal intrusion response strategy in fog computing based on the FC-IDS scheme proposed in our previous work. We postulate the intrusion process in fog computing and describe it with a mathematical model based on differential game theory. According to this model, the optimal response strategy is obtained corresponding to the optimal intrusion strategy. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our security model can effectively stabilize the intrusion frequency of the invaders in fog computing.

Moreover, the distributed nature of the smart city and IoT infrastructure hs led to issues in regards to service availability, reliability, sustainability and security. Edge computing provides a decentralized computing and communication framework for different types of applications such as intelligent transportation systems, cognitive assistance, health and social services. Edge computing helps in improving the performance of such applications and reduces the end-to-end latency incurred for such time-critical applications. In this article, we introduce a trustworthy smart city service delivery solution at the edge of the network. The solution uses a collaborative technique between distributed edge servers and privacy mediator nodes with the support of an intrusion detection system to enhance the availability, reliability and security of smart city applications. Simulation results show a reduction in the delay per service request by 39.2% for highly dense environments, and up to 62.6% for lightly dense environments. Moreover, the solution reduces the dropped service requests below 2% with high accuracy and detection rates and low false-negative rates.

J	Zhou, LY; Guo, HQ; Deng, GL				Zhou, Luying; Guo, Huaqun; Deng, Gelei			A fog computing based approach to DDoS mitigation in IIoT systems	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						DDoS; Attack detection; Mitigation; Fog computing; VNF	INTRUSION DETECTION; BOTNET	Distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyber-attack poses a severe threat to the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) operation due to the security vulnerabilities resulted from increased connectivity and openness, and the large number of deployed low computation power devices. This paper applies Fog computing concept in DDoS mitigation by allocating traffic monitoring and analysis work close to local devices, and, on the other hand, coordinating and consolidating work to cloud central servers so as to achieve fast response while at low false alarm rate. The mitigation scheme consists of real-time traffic filtering via field firewall devices, which are able to reversely filter the signature botnet attack packets; offline specification based traffic analysis via virtualized network functions (VNFs) in the local servers; and centralized coordination via cloud server, which consolidates and correlates the information from the distributed local servers to make a more accurate decision. The proposed scheme is tested in an industrial control system testbed and the experiments evaluate the detection time and rate for two types of DDoS attacks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.

J	Al-Otaibi, B; Al-Nabhan, N; Tian, Y				Al-Otaibi, Basmah; Al-Nabhan, Najla; Tian, Yuan			Privacy-Preserving Vehicular Rogue Node Detection Scheme for Fog Computing	SENSORS			English	Article						security; VANET; fog computing; rogue node detection; privacy preservation; authentication	INTRUSION DETECTION; EFFICIENT; SECURE; INTERNET	In the last few decades, urban areas across the world have experienced rapid growth in transportation technology with a subsequent increase in transport-related challenges. These challenges have increased our need to employ technology for creating more intelligent solutions. One of the essential tools used to address challenges in traffic is providing vehicles with information about traffic conditions in nearby areas. Vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANETs) allow vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication with the aim of providing safe and efficient transportation. Since drivers might make life-critical decisions based on information provided by other vehicles, dealing with rogue vehicles that send invalid data or breach users' privacy is an essential security issue in VANETs. This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving vehicular rogue node detection scheme using fog computing. The proposed scheme improves vehicle privacy, communication between vehicles, and computation efficiency by avoiding the exchange of traffic data between vehicles, allowing communication only through roadside units (RSUs). This scheme also proposes an RSU authentication mechanism, along with a mechanism that would allow RSUs to detect and eliminate vehicles providing false traffic data, which will improve the accuracy and efficiency of VANETs. The proposed scheme is analyzed and evaluated using simulation, which presents significant improvements for data processing, accurately detecting rogue vehicles, minimizing overhead, and immunizing the system against colluding vehicles.

The mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm was developed to improve the performance of these devices. This new computation architecture allows for the mobile devices to execute applications on fog nodes at the network edge; this process is called data processing offloading. This article presents a security model for the externalization of application execution in multi-tier MEC environments. The principal novelty of this study is that the model is able to modify the required security level in each tier of the distributed architecture as a function of the degree of trust associated with that tier. The basic idea is that a higher degree of trust requires a lower level of security, and vice versa. A formal framework is introduced that represents the general environment of application execution in distributed MEC architectures. An architecture is proposed that allows for deployment of the model in production environments and is implemented for evaluation purposes. The results show that the security model can be applied in multi-tier MEC architectures and that the model produces a minimal overhead, especially for computationally intensive applications.

M.; Zheng, Lixin; Wang, Shangguang; Huang, Chao; Lin, Tao			Intrusion Detection System Based on Decision Tree over Big Data in Fog Environment	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article								Fog computing, as the supplement of cloud computing, can provide low-latency services between mobile users and the cloud. However, fog devices may encounter security challenges as a result of the fog nodes being close to the end users and having limited computing ability. Traditional network attacks may destroy the system of fog nodes. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a proactive security protection technology and can be used in the fog environment. Although IDS in tradition network has been well investigated, unfortunately directly using them in the fog environment may be inappropriate. Fog nodes produce massive amounts of data at all times, and, thus, enabling an IDS system over big data in the fog environment is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose an IDS system based on decision tree. Firstly, we propose a preprocessing algorithmto digitize the strings in the given dataset and then normalize the whole data, to ensure the quality of the input data so as to improve the efficiency of detection. Secondly, we use decision tree method for our IDS system, and then we compare this method with Naive Bayesian method as well as KNN method. Both the 10% dataset and the full dataset are tested. Our proposed method not only completely detects four kinds of attacks but also enables the detection of twenty-two kinds of attacks. The experimental results show that our IDS system is effective and precise. Above all, our IDS system can be used in fog computing environment over big data.

Thus, this protection becomes crucial with a typical Internet-of-Things (IoT) setup, as it usually involves several IoT-based data sources interacting with the physical world within various application domains, such as agriculture, health care, home automation, critical industrial processes, etc. Unfortunately, contemporary IoT devices often offer very limited security features, laying themselves open to always new and more sophisticated attacks and also inhibiting the expected global adoption of IoT technologies, not to mention millions of IoT devices already deployed without any hardware security support. In this context, it is crucial to develop tools able to detect such cyber threats. In this article, we present Passban, an intelligent intrusion detection system (IDS) able to protect the IoT devices that are directly connected to it. The peculiarity of the proposed solution is that it can be deployed directly on very cheap IoT gateways (e.g., single-board PCs currently costing few tens of U.S. dollars), hence taking full advantage of the edge computing paradigm to detect cyber threats as close as possible to the corresponding data sources. We will demonstrate that Passban is able to detect various types of malicious traffic, including Port Scanning, HTTP and SSH Brute Force, and SYN Flood attacks with very low false positive rates and satisfactory accuracies.

As fog nodes are resource constrained, a traditional intrusion detection system (IDS) cannot be directly deployed in F-RANs due to the communication overhead and computational complexity. To address this challenge, we propose a skyline query-based scheme that can analyze the IDS log statistics of fog nodes and provide a complete data processing flow. Specifically, a three-step solution is proposed. First, a lightweight fog node filtering strategy is proposed to filter the raw data, which can reduce the fog-cloud communication overhead. Second, a sliding-window-based mechanism is developed in the cloud server to efficiently process the asynchronous data flow. Then, using the pre-processed data, a set of seriously attacked nodes will be identified by the skyline query. Third, the security threat level of each individual fog node is calculated using the unascertained measure, which can determine the degree of security threat. The numerical simulations show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce communication overhead and computational complexity.

Security is still a big challenge for this type of applications. In this paper, we proposed and applied a trust management framework which can assess trust for applications and computing resources. Moreover, the framework can help vendors to dynamically configure resources based on the real-time trust information.

Intrusion detection in Edge-of-Things computing	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article						Deep learning; Deep belief network; Edge computing; Intrusion detection; Internet-of-Things	DETECTION SYSTEM; IOT; CLOUD	Edge-of-Things (EoT) is a new evolving computing model driven by the Internet of Things (IoT). It enables data processing, storage, and service to be shifted from the Cloud to nearby Edge devices/systems such as smartphones, routers, and base stations on the IoT paradigm. However, this architectural shift causes the security and privacy issues to migrate to the different layers of the Edge architecture. Therefore, detecting intrusion in such a distributed environment is difficult. In this scenario, an Intrusion Detection Systems is necessary. Here, we propose an approach to quickly and accurately detect intrusive activities in the EoT network, to realize the full potential of the IoT. Specifically, we propose a deep belief network (DBN) based on an advanced intrusion detection approach. We studied different detection models, by using different structures of DBNs, and compared them with existing detection techniques. Test results show that the proposed methodology performs essentially superior to the current state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Now-a-days, we see a lot of applications that are making our lives comfortable such as smart cars, smart homes, smart traffic management, smart offices, smart medical consultation, smart cities, etc. All such facilities are in the reach of a common man because of the advancement in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Because of this advancement, new computing and communication environment such as Internet of Things (IoT) came into picture. Lot of research work is in progress in IoT domain which helps for the overall development of the society and makes the lives easy and comfortable. But in the resource constrained environment of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and IoT, it is almost inconceivable to establish a fully secure system. As we are moving forward very fast, technology is becoming more and more vulnerable to the security threats. In future, the number of Internet connected people will be less than the smart objects so we need to prepare a robust system for keeping the above mentioned environments safe and standardized it for the smooth conduction of communication among IoT objects. In this survey paper, we provide the details of threat model applicable for the security of WSN and IoT based communications. We also discuss the security requirements and various attacks possible in WSN and IoT based communication environments. The emerging projects of WSNs integrated to IoT are also briefed. We then provide the details of different architectures of WSN and IoT based communication environments. Next, we discuss the current issues and challenges related to WSN and IoT. We also provide a critical literature survey of recent intrusion detection protocols for IoT and WSN environments along with their comparative analysis. A taxonomy of security and privacy-preservation protocols in WSN and IoT is also highlighted. Finally, we discuss some research challenges which need to be addressed in the coming future.

Identification of malicious edge devices in fog computing environments	INFORMATION SECURITY JOURNAL			English	Article						Edge device; fog computing; Internet of Things; intrusion detection system; two-stage Markov model; virtual honeypot device	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; INSIDER THREAT; INTRUSION DETECTION; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; SECURITY; CLOUD; NETWORKS; ATTACKS; FRAMEWORK; ISSUES	Device security is one of the major challenges for successful implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and fog computing. Researchers and IT organizations have explored many solutions to protect systems from unauthenticated device attacks (known as outside device attacks). Fog computing uses many edge devices (e.g., router, switch, and hub) for latency-aware processing of collected data. So, identification of malicious edge devices is one of the critical activities in data security of fog computing. Preventing attacks from malicious edge devices is more difficult because they have certain granted privileges to store and process the data. In this article, a proposed framework uses three technologies, a Markov model, an intrusion detection system (IDS), and a virtual honeypot device (VHD) to identify malicious edge devices in a fog computing environment. A two-stage Markov model is used to categorize edge devices effectively into four different levels. The VHD is designed to store and maintain a log repository of all identified malicious devices, which assists the system to defend itself from any unknown attacks in the future. The proposed model is tested in a simulated environment, and results indicate the effectiveness of the system. The proposed model is successful in identifying the malicious device as well as reducing the false IDS alarm rate.

Recently, security breaches in many IoT applications have indicated that IoT applications may put the physical systems at risk. Severe resource constraints and insufficient security design are two major causes of many security problems in IoT applications. As an extension of the cloud, the emerging edge computing with rich resources provides us a new venue to design and deploy novel security solutions for IoT applications. Although there are some research efforts in this area, edge-based security designs for IoT applications are still in its infancy. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of existing IoT security solutions at the edge layer as well as to inspire more edge-based IoT security designs. We first present an edge-centric IoT architecture. Then, we extensively review the edge-based IoT security research efforts in the context of security architecture designs, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, authentication and authorization protocols, and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Finally, we propose our insight into future research directions and open research issues.	[Sha, Kewei; Yang, T.

In this paper, we propose a security architecture based on cellular networks and Multiple-access Edge Computing to collect sensors' information in real time. In the proposed architecture, users will interface the Internet of Things devices using their smartphones. The smartphones can interact with the cellular network and the Internet of Things devices at the same time. This unique ability is leveraged to provide strong authentication and confidentiality in accessing the Internet of Things devices. Also in our architecture, we use gateways, as intermediate nodes that can interact with both the smartphones and the sensor nodes. Therefore, our architecture includes a revocation mechanism for captured gateways. We propose an architecture for the Internet of Things devices along with protocols that can be used to establish security.

This leads to increase in the latency of cloud services and by extension latency in many IoT applications. To reduce this latency, computing devices are installed at the edge of the network close to the user. These devices are called Fog Nodes. They allow the user to process some data without going all the way to the data center. While the data centers are equipped with abundant resources (i.e. processors, energy and memory), the fog devices are not. This means traditional techniques for preventing intrusion are not applicable at the fog level, because they will incur more latency and/or energy consumption. Therefore, there is a need for low resource demanding, yet strong security system that will protect the fog layer from being attacked. This paper proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for Man in the Middle (MitM) attack at the fog layer. The IDS consists of IDS nodes that periodically interrogate nodes one hop away. The IPS uses lightweight encryption to prevent Man in the Middle attack and its variants (i.e. Eavesdropping, Packet Modification and Wormhole attack). (C) 2018 The Authors.

Due to the dual constraints of the hybrid feature of edge computing networks and the uncertainty of new attack features, implementing active defence measures such as detection, evasion, trap, and control is essential for the security protection of edge computing networks with high real-time and continuity requirements. The basic idea of safe active defence is to make the defence gain more significant than the attack loss. To encounter the new attacks with uncertain features introduced by the ubiquitous transmission network in the edge computing network, this paper investigates the attack behaviour and presents an attack-defence mechanism based on game theory. Based on the idea of dynamic intrusion detection, we utilize the game theory in the field of edge computing network and suggest a data-driven mimicry intrusion detection game model-based technique called GLIDE. The game income of participants and utility computing methods under different deployment strategies are analysed in detail. According to the proof analysis of the Nash equilibrium condition in the model, the contradictory dynamic game relationship is described. Therefore, the optimal deployment strategy of the multiredundancy edge computing terminal intrusion detection service in the edge computing network is obtained by solving the game balance point. The detection probability of the edge computing network for network attacks is improved, and the cost of intrusion detection of the edge computing network is reduced.

Conventional IT security approaches are centralized and have limitations in terms of scale, network-wide monitoring and resources for distributed detection. This paper proposes a newer approach that integrates multi-layer cooperative security intelligence on to a converged Software-Defined-Networking/Network-Function-Virtualization architecture in typical Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) scenario. The key features of framework include: a) distributed lightweight real-time DDoS Threat Analytics and Response Framework (DTARS), to identify DDoS/botnets closer to the source of attacks b) behavioral monitoring and profiling functions in data plane and validation of control plane operations, c) advanced correlation, signature, and anomaly detection techniques, d) real-time threat analytics system e) scalable and agile mitigation mechanisms based on a stateful-data plane and security-aware SDN stack. We evaluate the performance of DTARS framework within three practical MEC case studies: SDN enabled Mobile LTE MEC network, SDN enabled IoT MEC network and Software-Defined Datacenter Edge network. In comparison to legacy MEC network, DTARS incurs about 60% less overhead than the Legacy LTE and 40% lesser than a prior OVS SDN based MEC-LTE solution, detection speed that was about 10x faster, detection accuracy of about 96% at different attack intensities and improves the overall end-to-end connection management performance under rapid scaling of end users.

In this paper, we studied the security defense problem in MEC network environment. One big challenge is how to efficiently allocate resources to deploy Mobile-Edge Computing-Intrusion Detection Systems (MEC-IDS) in this system, since all the MEC hosts are composed of resource-constrained network devices. To tackle this challenge, a new resource allocation mechanism based on deterministic differential equation model is proposed and investigated. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the positive solution of this model are obtained by using Lyapuonv stability theory. Furthermore, we extended our study to MEC network environment with stochastic perturbation and established a new stochastic differential equation model. We proved the existence, uniqueness, persistence and oscillatory of the positive solution of this model and quantitatively analyzed the relationship between oscillation and intensity of stochastic perturbation.

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is known as an effective defence mechanism and most recently machine learning (ML) methods are used for its development. However, Internet of Things (IoT) devices often have limited computational resources such as limited energy source, computational power and memory, thus, traditional ML-based IDS that require extensive computational resources are not suitable for running on such devices. This study thus is to design and develop a lightweight ML-based IDS tailored for the resource-constrained devices. Specifically, the study proposes a lightweight ML-based IDS model namely IMPACT (IMPersonation Attack deteCTion using deep auto-encoder and feature abstraction). This is based on deep feature learning with gradient-based linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to deploy and run on resource-constrained devices by reducing the number of features through feature extraction and selection using a stacked autoencoder (SAE), mutual information (MI) and C4.8 wrapper. The IMPACT is trained on Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) to detect impersonation attack. Numerical results show that the proposed IMPACT achieved 98.22% accuracy with 97.64% detection rate and 1.20% false alarm rate and outperformed existing state-of-the-art benchmark models. Another key contribution of this study is the investigation of the features in AWID dataset for its usability for further development of IDS.

In this paper, we propose an attack-detection method, named Data Intrusion Detection System (DataIDS), based on real-time data analysis. As end devices are mainly resource constrained, Fog Computing (FC) is introduced to implement the DataIDS. FC increases storage, computation capabilities, and processing capabilities, allowing it to detect promptly an attack with respect to security solutions on the Cloud. This paper also considers an attack tree to model threats and vulnerabilities of Fog/IoT scenarios with heterogeneous devices and suggests countermeasure costs. We verify the performance of the proposed DataIDS, implementing a testbed with several devices that measure different physical quantities and by using standard data-gathering protocols.

This new network architecture model can deliver services directly from the cloud to the very edge of the network while providing the best efficiency in mobile networks. However, due to the dynamic, open, and collaborative nature of MEC network environments, network security issues have become increasingly complex. Devices cannot easily ensure obtaining satisfactory and safe services because of the numerous, dynamic, and collaborative character of MEC devices and the lack of trust between devices. The trusted cooperative mechanism can help solve this problem. In this paper, we analyze the MEC network structure and device-to-device (D2D) trusted cooperative mechanism and their challenging issues and then discuss and compare different ways to establish the D2D trusted cooperative relationship in MEC, such as social trust, reputation, authentication techniques, and intrusion detection. All these ways focus on enhancing the efficiency, stability, and security of MEC services in presenting trustworthy services.

However, the connection to Internet and public networks increases significantly the risk of the BAS networks being attacked due mainly to the significant increase in the attack surface. In this paper, we present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that combines context awareness and Cyber DNA techniques to detect network misbehavior from security and functionality perspectives. We developed runtime models for service interactions and functionality patterns by modeling the information that is continuously acquired from building assets into two novel data structures: Protocol Context Aware and sensor-DNA. Our IDS uses Anomaly Behavior Analysis techniques to accurately detect anomalous events triggered by cyber-attacks or any failure. A classification of detected attacks allow our IDS to automatically launch protective countermeasures. We evaluate our approach in the Smart Building testbed developed at the University of Arizona Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing, by launching several cyber-attacks that exploit the generic vulnerabilities of BAS.

There are several security loopholes in the IoT network. Intrusion can lead to performance degradation and pose a threat to data security. Hence, there is a need for a method to detect intrusion in the IoT networks. Existing solutions use supervised-learning-based intrusion detection methods that need a huge labeled data set for better accuracy. It is not easy to source out a huge labeled data set because the size of the IoT network is huge. To overcome some of the impediments in the existing solutions, we propose a novel SDRK machine learning (ML) algorithm to detect intrusion. SDRK leverages supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) and unsupervised clustering techniques. The intrusion detection and mitigation algorithms are placed in the fog nodes that are between IoT and cloud layers. We test our proposed methodology against the data deluge (DD) attack in the testbed. The SDRK model is tested on the benchmark NSL-KDD data set. We compare the results with state-of-the-art solutions. When testing with the NSL-KDD data set, we find that SDRK detects the attacks with improved accuracy of 99.78%.	[Ravi, Nagarathna; Shalinie, S.

Attacks to capture information and overload services are common. This fact makes security techniques indispensable in IoT en-vironments. Intrusion detection is one of the vital security points, aimed at identifying attempted attacks. The characteristics of IoT devices make it impossible to apply these solutions in this environment. Also, the existing anomaly-based methods for multiclass detection do not present acceptable accuracy. We present an intrusion detection architecture that operates in the fog computing layer. It has two steps and aims to classify events into specific types of attacks or non-attacks, for the execution of countermeasures. Our work presents a relevant con-tribution to the state of the art in this aspect. We propose a hybrid binary classification method called DNN-kNN. It has high accuracy and recall rates and is ideal for composing the first level of the two-stage detection method of the presented architecture. The approach is based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm. It was evaluated with the public databases NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017. We used the method of selecting attributes based on the rate of information gain. The approach proposed in this work obtained 99.77% accuracy for the NSL-KDD dataset and 99.85% accuracy for the CICIDS2017 dataset. The experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid approach was able to achieve greater precision about classic machine learning approaches and the recent advances in intrusion detection for IoT systems. In addition, the approach works with low overhead in terms of memory and processing costs.

Blockchain supports decentralized architecture and provides secure management, authentication, and access to IoT systems by deploying smart contracts provided by Ethereum. The growing demand and expansion of blockchain-IoT systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. Moreover, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are the most challenging threats to smart contracts in blockchain-IoT systems. The 2016 decentralized autonomous organization and 2017 parity wallet attacks exposed the critical fault-lines among Ethereum smart contracts. Currently, there is no security mechanism available for smart contracts after its deployment in blockchain-IoT systems. In order to address these challenges, first we use two artificial intelligence techniques, random forest (RF) and XGBoost that gives full autonomy in decision making capabilities in the proposed security framework. Second, for data load balancing and distributed file storage of IoT data, interplanetary file system is suggested. Finally, we are the first to propose a distributed framework based on fog computing to detect DDoS attacks in smart contracts. The performance of the detection system is evaluated using actual IoT dataset, namely, BoT-IoT. The proposed system is evaluated in terms of accuracy (AC), detection rate (DR), and false alarm rate (FAR). The results confirms the superiority of the proposed framework over some of the recent state-of-art techniques in detecting rare attacks. The proposed framework has achieved DR up to 99.99% using RF by using 10 features of BoT-IoT dataset.

In such a scenario, the attacker introduces many attacks to the edge before forwarding them to distributed servers. This necessitates intrusion detection systems for such environments to mitigate security attacks. This paper has projected a basis for characterization of intrusive behaviors in a distributed system based on the functional link neural nets response weighted-average and teaching-learning metaheuristic with elitism on weight-space. The proposed technique makes use of teaching-learning metaheuristic optimization to obtain suitable parameters for the functional link neural net. Furthermore, the processing of duplicate parameters is successfully avoided by using mutation operation. In addition to this, in this paper the proposed method is found to be more efficient in terms of computational burden.

However, WSNs are typically deployed in potentially untrusted environments. Therefore, it is imperative to address the security challenges before they can be implemented. In this paper, we propose a software-defined security framework that combines intrusion prevention in conjunction with a collaborative anomaly detection systems. Initially, an IPS-based authentication process is designed to provide a lightweight intrusion prevention scheme in the data plane. Subsequently, a collaborative anomaly detection system is leveraged with the aim of supplying a cost-effective intrusion detection solution near the data plane. Moreover, to correlate the true positive alerts raised by the sensor nodes in the network edge, a Smart Monitoring System (SMS) is exploited in the control plane. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated under different security scenarios as well as compared with other methods, where the model's high security and reduction of false alarms are demonstrated.

In this paper, we firstly explore and enhance Mirai botnet to a sophisticated multi-targets low-rate TCP attack network, which makes edge LR-DDoS more powerful and obfuscates their activity. And then, we develop a novel intrusion detection and defense hybrid method for above CPSS LR-DDoS scenario in edge environment, which takes advantage of locality sensitive features extraction and Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) to auto learn the optimal features of the original data distribution and employs deep reinforcement learning Q-network as the powerful decision maker to defend attacks. The experimental results in detection phase prove the proposed method can distinguish abnormal network attack flows with higher detection accuracy and faster response time than kinds of Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-means and Surface Learning Neural Network etc. Even more, it has a certain detection rate for unknown new attacks, which means the method is effective and suitable for the actual network environment. The experimental results in defense phase prove it can defense LR-DDoS attacks smoothly.

This paradigm is changed with the advent of the Industrial Internet of Things that foresees flexible and interconnected systems. In this contribution, a device acting as a connection between the operational technology network and information technology network is proposed. The device is an intrusion detection system related to legacy systems that is able to collect and reporting data to and from industrial IoT devices. It is based on the common signature based intrusion detection system developed in the information technology domain, however, to cope with the constraints of the operation technology domain, it exploits anomaly based features. Specifically, it is able to analyze the traffic on the network at application layer by mean of deep packet inspection, parsing the information carried by the proprietary protocols. At a later stage, it collect and aggregate data from and to IoT domain. A simple set up is considered to prove the effectiveness of the approach.

Further, some IoT devices are latency-sensitive. Such sensitivity makes it harder for far clouds to handle the IoT needs in a timely manner. A new technology named Fog computing has emerged as a solution to such problems. Fog computing relies on close by computational devices to handle the conventional cloud load. However, Fog computing introduced additional problems related to the trustworthiness and safety of such devices. Unfortunately, the suggested architectures did not consider such problem. In this paper we present a novel self-configuring fog architecture to support IoT networks with security and trust in mind. We realize the concept of Moving-target defense by mobilizing the applications inside the fog using live migrations. Performance evaluations using a benchmark for mobilized applications showed that the added overhead of live migrations is very small making it deployable in real scenarios. Finally, we presented a mathematical model to estimate the survival probabilities of both static and mobile applications within the fog. Moreover, this work can be extended to other systems such as mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETS) or in vehicular cloud computing (VCC).

Taking the advantage of cloud computing, the process of algorithm selection can be offloaded to the cloud, but it may cause communication delay and additional burden on the cloud side. This issue may become worse when it comes to distributed intrusion detection systems (DIDSs), i.e., some IoT applications might require very short response time and most of the end nodes in IoT are energy constrained things. In this paper, with the advent of edge computing, we propose a framework for improving the intelligent false alarm reduction for DIDSs based on edge computing devices (i.e., the data can be processed at the edge for shorter response time and could be more energy efficient). The evaluation shows that the proposed framework can help reduce the workload for the central server and shorten the delay as compared to the similar studies.

Correctional Service Canada (CSC) operates 57 Institutions equipped with a range of mission critical Security, Communications and Access Management systems. These include CCTV assessment, intrusion detection, radio communications and door control systems. User Interfaces range from colour graphic touch screens to knobs, push buttons etc. Operational and technical challenges include the following issues: -sub-system technology is vendor specific, -reliability is critical in a challenging environment, -system maintenance is expensive, -inconsistent  Look and Feel resulting in usability issues, -costly to add new systems, multiple, legacy and proprietary protocols & connectivity approaches, legacy installations are cable intensive, -minimal operator or maintenance training crossover, -procurement requirements drive  silo system implementation. The objective is to develop a  next generation systems architecture that will:  abstract the subsystem user management interfaces, ensuring all sub-systems can be managed using a simple, consistent graphical user interface, accessible using a web browser; model the data and behaviour of the edge devices, doors; cameras, sensors, etc. and normalizes it; allowing them to be managed by and provide notifications to standard software based applications; support inter-domain interoperability; use an industry standard communications protocol, likely with extensions, such as BACNet or SNMP, for edge device to application server connectivity; use TCP/ IP over fibre as the preferred transport, network and physical technologies; integrate legacy sub-systems into the application server using mediation software; define the look and feel of the graphical icons that represent the edge devices and the physical environment in which they are placed, so that each domain is presented in a consistent manner. Developing and adopting this architecture will allow Correctional Service Canada to address the challenges of its unique environment and support the definition, procurement and deployment of subsystems more effectively.

Engineering the security of such systems must acknowledge the peculiar conditions under which such systems operate: low computational capacity, distributed decision-making, significant node churn, etc. These conditions must, therefore, be supported by the techniques and methodologies for building secure and robust IoT systems. With CAAVI-RICS methodology we explore credibility, authentication, authorization, verification, and integrity of IoT and edge computing systems, through explaining the rationale, influence, concerns, and security solutions that accompany them. Our contribution is a complete and detailed systematic categorization and streamlining of security problems, covering the security environment of IoT and edge computing systems.

Different IoT applications nowadays are centered on computerizing various errands and are attempting to engage the inanimate physical items to act without direct supervision of a human. The current and forthcoming IoT services are exceptionally encouraging to build the degree of solace, proficiency, and automation for the clients. To obtain the option to actualize such a world in a continuously developing manner requires high security, protection, verification, and recuperation from assaults. Right now, incorporating the requisite changes in IoT systems engineering to achieve end-to-end, stable IoT infrastructure is paramount. In this research, a comprehensive analysis is incorporated into the security-relevant problems and threat wellsprings in IoT resources or applications. Specific that and current advancements based on maintaining a high degree of confidence in IoT apps are addressed while looking at the security issues.

It is worth to remark that the main paradigm which will take advantage from 5G is really the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the spreading of 5G technology also generates important concerns in terms of security and privacy, due to the continuous and wireless connection to the network, which hinders the reliability of the involved devices. This paper deeply analyzed the current state of the art about the existing security and privacy solutions tailored to 5G. More in detail, the following requirements are discussed: data integrity, confidentiality, authentication, access control, non-repudiation, trust, privacy, identity management, key management, policy enforcement, and intrusion detection. Furthermore, the paper aims to shed the light on future research directions towards the realization of secure and privacy aware 5G systems. To this end, the role of emerging paradigms, such as IoT, fog computing, and blockchain is investigated.

It is a fact that at present, there is a dearth of consolidated and methodical visions for assuring the security of IoT. This owes to its unique characteristics like interdependence of IoT devices and services, device heterogeneity, mobility, affinity to owners, pervasiveness, and unattended nature. The constraints of energy, memory, bandwidth and computability further complicate this picture. The strategies available in the literature today do not entirely consider this intricate nature of IoT environments. Moreover, uncertainty is not adequately acknowledged by the researchers while designing the security procedures for IoT, even though most of the IoT related security problems stem from an uncertain environment. This paper focuses on addressing this uncertainty, along with the other major security issues of IoT. It gives detailed categorization of the attacks in IoT. To this end, a Fuzzy Logic and Fog based Secure Architecture for IoT (FLFSIoT) has been proposed in this paper that works in real-time. In FLFSIoT, fuzzy logic has been used to alleviate the uncertainty of belonging to one crisp cluster of an edge node and for detecting various classical attacks. The Fog supported IoT architecture has been used to make FLFSIoT intrinsically more secure in comparison to the cloud-supported IoT by omitting the latency and other issues. As such, this work feeds the benefits of fuzzy log and fog computing into the carving of a generic solution to the IoT's security problem. The efficiency of FLFSIoT has been evaluated against the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Collusion attacks, and it has been observed that it gives more accurate results than the existing benchmarks.

Hence, intrusion detection accuracy as well as efficiency is sensitive to the normal operation of VANETs. Regarding this, in this article we propose an architecture of IDPS for VANETs. One of the highlights of the architecture is that it applies RL throughout the architecture in order to deal with the dynamics of VANETs and to make proper decisions according to current VANETs states, aiming at high detection accuracy. On the other hand, the architecture is deployed in EC in an attempt to obtain low detection latency with high processing efficiency, since VANETs IDPS is sensitive to latency, especially for safety applications. A case study is conducted to assess the validity of the proposed VANETs IDPS in EC, with the results revealing that it holds the capacity to detect and prevent intrusion in VANETs in complex environments.

These are the key enabling technologies for future applications in 5G and locality-based Internet of things (IoT)/wireless sensor network services. The proliferation of IoT devices at the Edge networks is driving the growth of all-connected world of Internet traffic. In the Cloud-to-Things continuum, processing of information and data at the Edge mandates development of security best practices to arise within a fog computing environment. Service providers are transforming their business using NFV-based services and SDN-enabled networks. The SDN paradigm offers an easily programmable model, global view, and control for modern networks, which demand faster response to security incidents and dynamically enforce countermeasures to intrusions and cyberattacks. This article proposes an autonomic multilayer security framework called Distributed Threat Analytics and Response System (DTARS) for a converged architecture of Fog/Edge computing and SDN infrastructures, for emerging applications in IoT and 5G networks. The major detection scheme is deployed within the data plane, consisting of a coarse-grained behavioral, anti-spoofing, flow monitoring and fine-grained traffic multi-feature entropy-based algorithms. We developed exemplary defense applications under DTARS framework, on a malware testbed imitating the real-life DDoS/botnets such as Mirai. The experiments and analysis show that DTARS is capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 95% under attack intensities up to 50 000 packets/s. The benign traffic forwarding rate remains unaffected with DTARS, while it drops down to 65% with traditional NIDS for advanced DDoS attacks. Further, DTARS achieves this performance without incurring additional latency due to data plane overhead.

Dynamic decision support for resource offloading in heterogeneous Internet of Things environments	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						Internet of things; IoT offloading; Computation offloading; Edge computing; Cloud computing; Decision support; EdgeCloudSim simulator	INTRUSION DETECTION; MOBILE EDGE; COMPUTATION; OPTIMIZATION; WORKLOAD	Computation offloading is one of the primary technological enablers of the Internet of Things (IoT), as it helps address individual devices' resource restrictions. In the past, offloading would always utilise remote cloud infrastructures, but the increasing size of IoT data traffic and the real-time response requirements of modern and future IoT applications have led to the adoption of the edge computing paradigm, where the data is processed at the edge of the network. The decision as to whether cloud or edge resources will be utilised is typically taken at the design stage based on the type of the IoT device. Yet, the conditions that determine the optimality of this decision, such as the arrival rate, nature and sizes of the tasks, and crucially the real-time condition of the networks involved, keep changing. At the same time, the energy consumption of IoT devices is usually a key requirement, which is affected primarily by the time it takes to complete tasks, whether for the actual computation or for offloading them through the network. Here, we model the expected time and energy costs for the different options of offloading a task to the edge or the cloud, as well as of carrying out on the device itself. We use this model to allow the device to take the offloading decision dynamically as a new task arrives and based on the available information on the network connections and the states of the edge and the cloud. Having extended EdgeCloudSim to provide support for such dynamic decision making, we are able to compare this approach against IoT-first, edge-first, cloud-only, random and application-oriented probabilistic strategies. Our simulations on four different types of IoT applications show that allowing customisation and dynamic offloading decision support can improve drastically the response time of time-critical and small-size applications, and the energy consumption not only of the individual IoT devices but also of the system as a whole. This paves the way for future IoT devices that optimise their application response times, as well as their own energy autonomy and overall energy efficiency, in a decentralised and autonomous manner.

In 2020 more than 25% of identified attacks in enterprises will involve the IoT. Hence, it is very important to treat IoT security as a mandatory design factor. Moreover the deployed IoT system should be continuously monitored to detect malicious behaviour such as packet dropping, worm propagation or jammer attacks. In the paper we propose the anomaly based Intrusion Detection System dedicated to Bluetooth Mesh networks. The machine learning algorithm is used to classify traffic and detect malicious behaviour in IoT networks. The proposed solution involve cooperative decision making which is done by multiple watchdogs distributed in different regions of the considered network - which are responsible for processing of mostly local traffic. The optimal placement of watchdogs is proposed based on simulations done by BMWatchSim software. The experimental results coming from our testbed confirm that the watchdog placement proposed by simulator allow on effective detection of real-world intrusions.

Wi-Fi, as the de facto standard for high-throughput wireless connectivity, is highly vulnerable to packet-injection-based identity spoofing attacks (PI-ISAs). An attacker can spoof as the legitimate edge coordinator and perform denial of service (DoS) or even man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks with merely a laptop. Such vulnerability leads to serious systematic risks, especially for the core edge/cloud backbone network.In this paper, we propose PHYAlert, an identity spoofing attack alert system designed to protect a Wi-Fi-based edge network. PHYAlert profiles the wireless link with the rich dimensional Wi-Fi PHY layer information and enables real-time authentication for Wi-Fi frames. We prototype PHYAlert with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices and perform extensive experiments in different scenarios. The experiments verify the feasibility of spoofing detection based on PHY layer information and show that PHYAlert can achieve an 8x improvement in the false positive rate over the conventional signal-strength-based solution.

Indeed, the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), commonly referred to as Industry 4.0, promises to revolutionize production and manufacturing through the use of large numbers of networked embedded sensing devices, and the combination of emerging computing technologies, such as Fog/Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology. Unsurprisingly, such concerns led to an exponential growth of published research over the last few years. To get an overview of the field, we deem it important to systematically survey the academic literature so far, and distill from it various security requirements as well as their popularity. This paper consists of two contributions: our primary contribution is a systematic review of the literature over the period 2011-2019 on IIoT Security, focusing in particular on the security requirements of the IIoT. Our secondary contribution is a reflection on how the relatively new paradigm of Fog computing can be leveraged to address these requirements, and thus improve the security of the IIoT.

However, these algorithms are often based on the average consensus primitive, which is, unfortunately, vulnerable to data injection attacks. Recognizing this challenge, this work proposes three novel methods for detecting and localizing adversarial nodes using neural network (NN) models. The methods proposed are based on fully distributed algorithms, wherein each node locally updates its local states by exchanging information with its neighbors without supervision. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach leverages the automatic learning characteristics of NN to reduce the dependence on pre-designed models and human expertise in complex internal attack scenarios. Simulation results show that the NN-based methods can significantly improve the attacker detection and localization performance.

To cope with this problem, in this paper, we address the security issues related to covert channels applied to industrial networks, identifying the new vulnerability points when ITs converge with operational technologies such as edge computing infrastructures. Specifically, we define two signaling strategies where we exploit the Modbus/transmission control protocol (TCP) as target to set up a covert channel. Once the threat channel is established, passive and active offensive methodologies are further exploited by implementing and testing them on a real industrial Internet of Things testbed. The experimental results highlight the potential damage of such specific threats and the easy extrapolation of the attacks to other types of channels in order to show the new risks for the Industry 4.0. Related to this, we discuss some countermeasures offering an overview of possible mitigation and defensive measures.

By providing cloud services close to end-users, edge paradigms enhance the functionality of IoT deployments, and facilitate the creation of novel services such as augmented systems. Furthermore, the very nature of these paradigms also enables the creation of a proactive defense architecture, an immune system, which allows authorized immune cells (e.g., virtual machines) to traverse edge nodes and analyze the security and consistency of the underlying IoT infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze the requirements for the development of an immune system for the IoT, and propose a security architecture that satisfies these requirements. We also describe how such a system can be instantiated in edge computing infrastructures using existing technologies. Finally, we explore the potential application of immune systems to other scenarios and purposes.

The proposed HD-IDS is based on distributed Fog architecture using three hierarchical network levels (i.e., home area network, residential area network, and Fog operation center network). At each network level, we implement an IDS; thus, the system ensures three protection and detection levels. The problem is modeled using stochastic Markov chain process illustrating the transitions between different smart meter states.

High-performance, platform-independent DDoS detection for IoT ecosystems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE LCN: 2019 44TH ANNUAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON LOCAL COMPUTER NETWORKS (LCN 2019)	Conference on Local Computer Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	44th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (IEEE LCN)	OCT 14-17, 2019	Osnabruck, GERMANY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Comp Commun		Internet of Things; DDoS; Anomaly Detection; Dataplane Programmability; BPFabric; Edge Computing	ATTACK DETECTION	Most Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) detection and mitigation strategies for Internet of Things (IoT) are based on a remote cloud server or purpose-built middlebox executing complex intrusion detection methods, that impose stringent scalability and performance requirements on the IoT due to the vast amounts of traffic and devices to be handled. In this paper, we present an edge-based detection scheme using BPFabric, a high-speed, programmable data-plane switch architecture, and lightweight network functions to execute upstream anomaly detection. The proposed detection scheme ensures fast detection of DDoS attacks originated from IoT devices, while guaranteeing minimum resource usage and processing overhead. Our solution was compared against two widespread coarse-grained detection techniques, showing detection delays under 5ms, an overall accuracy of 93 - 95% and a bandwidth overhead of less than 1%.

The present paper focuses on discovering viable anomalies that have a significant potential to be associated with abnormal network behavior. Three approaches based on ML (Machine Learning) have been proposed to detect suspicious network behavior. These methods are an extension of the techniques discussed as part of the introduction below. The developed approaches in the current paper are evaluated by testing their efficiency against a real-time network attack using available open-source network tools. The results of the experiment demonstrate successful identification of anomalous instances from the telemetry data with a low false alarm rate. Further, we believe that our approaches can be directly deployed in a real-time environment (independently on the edge device or over the cloud) to strengthen the network security.

In this distributed sensor system scenario, due to the insecure interactions between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) networks, cyber-physical threats could lead to destructive consequences for environments and population safety. To deal with industrial cyber-physical security, modern anomaly detection systems implement innovative Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Unfortunately, current solutions still fail to provide an effective prevention to complex industrial threats. In this paper, we present KingFisher, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework based on ML. KingFisher is, to the best of our knowledge, the first solution that looks independently at IT and OT traffic, but also from sensors deployed to capture side-channel physical processes data (e.g., vibrations, background noise). Thanks to this feature, KingFisher can detect attacks that other systems would ignore. As our tests report, the correlation of inferred physical processes status with OT-network and IT-network data can give insights into suspicious and anomalous activities targeting industrial networks. For our framework, we use the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an unsupervised neural network model, to categorize data without a priori knowledge of the dataset. We evaluate the detection capabilities and performances of KingFisher in a proof of concept simulated industrial scenario under cyber-physical attacks. Our preliminary results show that KingFisher identifies attacks on both network and physical layers.

This architectural shift moves security and privacy issues from the Cloud to the different layers of the Fog architecture. In this scenario, IDSs are still necessary, but they need to be contextualized in the new architecture. Indeed, while on the one hand Fog computing provides intrinsic benefits (e.g., low latency), on the other hand, it introduces new design challenges. In this paper, we provide the following contributions: we analyze the possible IDS solutions that can be adopted within the different Fog computing tiers, together with their related deployment and design challenges; and, we propose some promising future directions, by taking into account the challenges left uncovered by the considered solutions.

Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation. However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development of agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three typical development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture, and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications, 6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies (5G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research directions of smart agriculture.

IoT structures the base of future infrastructures, developing the advancement of future smart cities that are naturally moderate. However, IoT is vulnerable to different cyber-attacks. The most critical issues of the IoT are security and privacy. In this research, the integration of IoT with cloud and fog computing can present an improved platform to support IoT smart city applications. Cloud computing can provide data storage at top-level management and fog computing can offer various services for supporting smart city applications based on IoT. The integrated architecture of the IoT-Fog-Cloud computing model is presented in this research. For the analysis based on Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) anomaly detection, the Improved Naive Bayes (INB) classifier based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is proposed in this work. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is used for the evaluation of the attack detection model. The PCA technique is used to extract features of the dataset, and the INB classifier is used for the classification of attacks. This technique is proposed to enhance the efficiency of the anomaly detection and to improve the performance analysis in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and detection rate. The INB-PCA achieved 92.48% accuracy and 95.35% detection rate.

Currently, Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides a promising way to build a secure and trusted VNF (virtual network function) by isolating VNF or sensitive data into an enclave. However, directly placing multiple VNFs in a single enclave will lose the scalability advantage of NFV. This paper combines SGX and click technology to design the virtual security function architecture based on multiple enclaves. In our design, the sensitive modules of a VNF are put into different enclaves and communicate by local attestation. The system can freely combine these modules according to user requirements, and increase the scalability of the system while protecting its running state security. In addition, we design a new hot-swapping scheme to enable the system to dynamically modify the configuration function at runtime, so that the original VNFs do not need to stop when the function of VNFs is modified. We implement an IDS (intrusion detection system) based on our architecture to verify the feasibility of our system and evaluate its performance. The results show that the overhead introduced by the system architecture is within an acceptable range.

J	Kumar, P; Gupta, GP; Tripathi, R				Kumar, Prabhat; Gupta, Govind P.; Tripathi, Rakesh			A distributed ensemble design based intrusion detection system using fog computing to protect the internet of things networks	JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING			English	Article; Early Access						Intrusion detection system; Anomaly detection; Ensemble learning; Fog computing; Internet of things (IoT); Feature selection	SECURITY	With the development of internet of things (IoT), capabilities of computing, networking infrastructure, storage of data and management have come very close to the edge of networks. This has accelerated the necessity of Fog computing paradigm. Due to availability of Internet, most of our business operations are integrated with IoT platform. Fog computing has enhanced the strategy of collecting and processing, huge amount of data. On the other hand, attacks and malicious activities has adverse consequences on the development of IoT, Fog, and cloud computing. This has led to development of many security models using fog computing to protect IoT network. Therefore, for dynamic and highly scalable IoT environment, a distributed architecture based intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that can distribute the existing centralized computing to local fog nodes and can efficiently detect modern IoT attacks. This paper proposes a novel distributed ensemble design based IDS using Fog computing, which combines k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, and Gaussian naive Bayes as first-level individual learners. At second-level, the prediction results obtained from first level is used by Random Forest for final classification. Most of the existing proposals are tested using KDD99 or NSL-KDD dataset. However, these datasets are obsolete and lack modern IoT-based attacks. In this paper, UNSW-NB15 and actual IoT-based dataset namely, DS2OS are used for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed system. The experimental result revealed that the proposed distributed IDS with UNSW-NB15 can achieve higher detection rate upto 71.18% for Backdoor, 68.98% for Analysis, 92.25% for Reconnaissance and 85.42% for DoS attacks. Similarly, with DS2OS dataset, detection rate is upto 99.99% for most of the attack vectors.

Due to the capacity-constrained nature of many IoT devices, edge computing has become a significant aid for IoT, replacing cloud computing to support the extremely low latency requirements. With the number of smart devices growing exponentially, the large attack surface created by these devices is concerning. Software-defined networking (SDN) based architectures come to the rescue of edge-assisted IoT environments to achieve enhanced security, and they strongly rely on intelligent decision-making capabilities to act upon the high volume of traffic they control. Machine learning-based intelligence is already utilized by these systems with successful results when abundant training data are available; however, most algorithms fail in the lack of sufficient training data. In this article, we propose Protedge, an SDN-based intelligent security architecture for edge-assisted IoT networks, which utilizes a few-shot learning classifier, namely prototypical networks, for highly accurate detection of intrusions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model with the Bot-IoT data set consisting of real-world IoT network flows, as well as an SDN data set modeling an edge-assisted IoT environment and the UNSW-NB15 data set, and show that the proposed model achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art models in the absence of large amounts of sample attacks. The proposed architecture is promising to achieve intelligent security in future's ubiquitous edge-enabled IoT with its low processing overhead and high intrusion detection accuracy.

J	Lawal, MA; Shaikh, RA; Hassan, SR				Lawal, Muhammad Aminu; Shaikh, Riaz Ahmed; Hassan, Syed Raheel			An Anomaly Mitigation Framework for IoT Using Fog Computing	ELECTRONICS			English	Article						anomaly mitigation; internet of things (IoT); Intrusion Detection System (IDS); fog computing; classification algorithms	INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM; INTERNET; SECURITY; THINGS; ATTACK; SCHEMES	The advancement in IoT has prompted its application in areas such as smart homes, smart cities, etc., and this has aided its exponential growth. However, alongside this development, IoT networks are experiencing a rise in security challenges such as botnet attacks, which often appear as network anomalies. Similarly, providing security solutions has been challenging due to the low resources that characterize the devices in IoT networks. To overcome these challenges, the fog computing paradigm has provided an enabling environment that offers additional resources for deploying security solutions such as anomaly mitigation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly mitigation framework for IoT using fog computing to ensure faster and accurate anomaly detection. The framework employs signature- and anomaly-based detection methodologies for its two modules, respectively. The signature-based module utilizes a database of attack sources (blacklisted IP addresses) to ensure faster detection when attacks are executed from the blacklisted IP address, while the anomaly-based module uses an extreme gradient boosting algorithm for accurate classification of network traffic flow into normal or abnormal. We evaluated the performance of both modules using an IoT-based dataset in terms response time for the signature-based module and accuracy in binary and multiclass classification for the anomaly-based module. The results show that the signature-based module achieves a fast attack detection of at least six times faster than the anomaly-based module in each number of instances evaluated. The anomaly-based module using the XGBoost classifier detects attacks with an accuracy of 99% and at least 97% for average recall, average precision, and average F1 score for binary and multiclass classification. Additionally, it recorded 0.05 in terms of false-positive rates.

The method employs tcpdump packets and extracts multiple features from the packet headers. The tcpdump packets are transferred into documents based on the features. A topic model is trained using only attack-free traffic in order to learn the behavior patterns of normal traffic. Then, the test traffic is analyzed against the learned behavior patterns to measure the extent to which the test traffic resembles the normal traffic. A threshold is defined in the training phase as the minimum likelihood of a host. In the test phase, when a host's test traffic has a likelihood lower than the host's threshold, the traffic is labeled as an intrusion. The intrusion detection system is validated using DARPA 1999 dataset. Experiment shows that our method is suitable to protect the security of MEC.

Some new security problems especially the data security and privacy issues have been introduced into the edge computing scenario. Through analyzing the biological immune principles, a novel idea for the problem of intrusion detection in edge computing is provided. Specifically, an edge intrusion detection system (Edge IDS) with a distributed structure, which has the characteristics of an imprecise model, self-learning, and strong interactivity, is constructed in a systematic way inspired by the biological immune principles. Moreover, a newly proposed gene immune detection algorithm (GIDA) is designed. In order that Edge IDS can deal with the dynamic data problem efficiently, the key functional components such as the remaining gene, niching strategy, and extracting vaccine are embedded into the GIDA algorithm. Furthermore, extensive simulation experiments are conducted, and the results show that the proposed Edge IDS can be adapted to the domain of edge computing with comparative performance advantages.

J	Wang, C; Wang, BL; Liu, HR; Qu, HK				Wang, Chao; Wang, Bailing; Liu, Hongri; Qu, Haikuo			Anomaly Detection for Industrial Control System Based on Autoencoder Neural Network	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article								As the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) develops rapidly, cloud computing and fog computing become effective measures to solve some problems, e.g., limited computing resources and increased network latency. The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a key factor within the development of IIoT, whose security affects the whole IIoT. ICS involves many aspects, like water supply systems and electric utilities, which are closely related to people's lives. ICS is connected to the Internet and exposed in the cyberspace instead of isolating with the outside recent years. The risk of being attacked increases as a result. In order to protect these assets, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have drawn much attention. As one kind of intrusion detection, anomaly detection provides the ability to detect unknown attacks compared with signature-based techniques, which are another kind of IDS. In this paper, an anomaly detection method with a composite autoencoder model learning the normal pattern is proposed. Unlike the common autoencoder neural network that predicts or reconstructs data separately, our model makes prediction and reconstruction on input data at the same time, which overcomes the shortcoming of using each one alone. With the error obtained by the model, a change ratio is put forward to locate the most suspicious devices that may be under attack. In the last part, we verify the performance of our method by conducting experiments on the SWaT dataset. The results show that the proposed method exhibits improved performance with 88.5% recall and 87.0% F1-score.

On-board sensors in the smartphone mounted on an entrance door records signals upon unwanted door opening. The access point is reconfigured to serve as a home server and thus it can process sensor data to detect unauthorized access to home by an intruder. Recycling devices enables a home owner to build own security system with no cost as well as helps our society deal with millions of retired devices and waste of computing resources in already-deployed IT devices. In order to improve detection accuracy, this paper proposes a detection method that employs a machine learning algorithm and an analysis technique of time series data. To minimize energy consumption on a battery-powered smartphone, the proposed system utilizes as few sensors as possible and offloads all the computation to the home edge server. We develop a prototype and run experiments to evaluate accuracy performance of the proposed system. Results show that it can detect intrusion with probability of 95% to 100%.

The novelty of attacks with each passing day poses a conundrum to the organizations and sectors deploying the IoT. The fact remains that conventional cybersecurity frameworks face the trouble of distinguishing unknown attacks in most scenarios. Recent studies explore the endless capabilities of machine learning (ML) in reinstating the security of the IoT infrastructure. ML includes the capability of self-study and training for discovering the path for security breach and attack detection. The training methodology and progression in ML is superior to centralized detection systems. A novel methodology of distributed training on fog node in the IoT architecture with exchange of parameters (DT-FN) enhancement of intelligence through machine learning is proposed in this paper. The analyses have demonstrated that appropriated assault recognition framework has outsmarted the incorporated discovery frameworks utilizing ML model. Intrusion detection system of IoT has been incorporated on DL for more effectiveness and identification of higher level security threats. Target prejudgement-based interruption identification framework for IoT has also been discussed. The key metrics that are considered are detection rate, detection accuracy, false alarm rate, F1 measurement, precision and recall.	[Sugi, S.

Quantum authentication is one of the latest extensions of authentication technology in quantum field. So far, most of the quantum identity authentication protocols proposed are based on noise-free environments. However, due to the existence of quantum noise in quantum channels is inevitable, the noise immunity is very important to quantum identity authentication. In this article, a novel quantum identity authentication protocol based on three-photon error avoidance code is proposed. In this protocol, quantum information is encoded on the noiseless subsystem, so the protocol can effectively resist on the interference of noise in the quantum channel to information transmission. The comprehensive analysis of antinoise performance and the security analysis on various eavesdropping attacks shows that the new protocol proposed in this article has not only good antinoise performance but also good security.

This real-time monitoring enables an analyst to quantify evolving and emerging threats to such network infrastructures. A framework for identifying patterns in observed cyberthreats and the use of these patterns for forecasting the growth of an emerging threat to network infrastructure is proposed. This framework enables predicting the maximum threat intensity and the time period over which this maximum intensity is likely to occur. The proposed framework integrates: (a) continuous monitoring of device/network activity, (b) forecasting behavior using exponentially weighted moving averages, (c) utilizing Fibonacci retracement for estimating the potential intensity of a cyberattack, and (d) linear regression for predicting response time for high risk thresholds and a machine learning strategy to predict potential risk over a pre-defined time window. Using this approach, we can produce time intervals between the forecast and the actual attacks using real-world network activity data. Our results show an average lead time of around 1.75 hours, providing a window of opportunity to limit the impact of an attack and counter it.

The sinkhole attacker nodes (SHA s) have some properties (for example, they first attract the other normal nodes for the shortest path to the destination and when normal nodes initiate the process of sending their packets through that path (i.e., via SHA), the attacker nodes start disrupting the traffic flow of the network). In the presence of SHAs, the destination (for example, sink node i.e., gateway/base station) does not receive the required information or it may receive partial or modified information. This results in reduction of the network performance and degradation in efficiency and reliability of the communication. In the presence of such an attack, the throughput decreases, end-to-end delay increases and packet delivery ratio decreases. Moreover, it may harm other network performance parameters. Hence, it becomes extremely essential to provide an effective and competent scheme to mitigate this attack in EIoT. In this paper, an intrusion detection scheme to protect EIoT environment against sinkhole attack is proposed, which is named as SAD-EIoT. In SAD-EIoT, the resource rich edge nodes (edge servers) perform the detection of different types of sinkhole attacker nodes with the help of exchanging messages. The practical demonstration of SAD-EIoT is also provided using the well known NS2 simulator to compute the various performance parameters. Additionally, the security analysis of SAD-EIoT is conducted to prove its resiliency against various types of SHAs. SAD-EIoT achieves around 95.83% detection rate and 1.03% false positive rate, which are considerably better than other related existing schemes. Apart from those, SAD-EIoT is proficient with respect to computation and communication costs. Eventually, SAD-EIoT will be a suitable match for those applications which can be used in critical and sensitive operations (for example, surveillance, security and monitoring systems).

However, wireless edge networks still face the risk of network attacks. To ensure the security of wireless edge networks, we present Federated Learning-based Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (FedAGRU), an intrusion detection algorithm for wireless edge networks. FedAGRU differs from current centralized learning methods by updating universal learning models rather than directly sharing raw data among edge devices and a central server. We also apply the attention mechanism to increase the weight of important devices, by avoiding the upload of unimportant updates to the server, FedAGRU can greatly reduce communication overhead while ensuring learning convergence. Our experimental results show that, compared with other centralized learning algorithms, FedAGRU improves detection accuracy by approximately 8%. In addition, FedAGRU's communication cost is 70% less than other federated learning algorithms, and it exhibits strong robustness against poisoning attacks.

The purpose of the IoT is to provide seamless services to anything, anytime at any place. IoT technologies play a crucial role everywhere, which brings the fourth revolution of disruptive technologies after the internet and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The Research & Development community has predicted that the impact of IoT will be more than the internet and ICT on society, which improves the well-being of society and industries. Addressing the predominant system-level design aspects like energy efficiency, robustness, scalability, interoperability, and security issues result in the use of a potential IoT system. This paper presents the current state of art of the functional pillars of IoT and its emerging applications to motivate academicians and researches to develop real-time, energy-efficient, scalable, reliable, and secure IoT applications. This paper summarizes the architecture of IoT, with the contemporary status of IoT architectures. Highlights of the IoT system-level issues to develop more advanced real-time IoT applications have been discussed. Millions of devices exchange information using different communication standards, and interoperability between them is a significant issue. This paper provides the current status of the communication standards and application layer protocols used in IoT with the detailed analysis. The computing paradigms like Cloud, Cloudlet, Fog, and Edge computing facilitate IoT with various services like data offloading, resource and device management, etc. In this paper, an exhaustive analysis of Edge Computing in IoT with different edge computing architectures and existing status are deliberated. The widespread adoption of IoT in society has resulted in privacy and security issues. This paper emphasizes on analyzing the security challenges, privacy and security threats, conventional mitigation techniques, and further scope for IoT security. The features like fewer memory footprints, scheduling, real-time task execution, fewer interrupt, and thread switching latency of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) enables the development of time critical IoT applications. Also, this review offers the analysis of the RTOS's suitable for IoT with the current status and networking stack. Finally, open research issues in IoT system development are discussed.	[Swamy, S.

J	Sadaf, K; Sultana, J				Sadaf, Kishwar; Sultana, Jabeen			Intrusion Detection Based on Autoencoder and Isolation Forest in Fog Computing	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Cloud computing; Edge computing; Forestry; Support vector machines; Autoencoder; fog computing; intrusion detection; isolation forest	DEEP LEARNING APPROACH; DETECTION SYSTEM; SPARSE AUTOENCODER; SECURITY; PRIVACY	Fog Computing has emerged as an extension to cloud computing by providing an efficient infrastructure to support IoT. Fog computing acting as a mediator provides local processing of the end-users' requests and reduced delays in communication between the end-users and the cloud via fog devices. Therefore, the authenticity of incoming network traffic on the fog devices is of immense importance. These devices are vulnerable to malicious attacks. All kinds of information, especially financial and health information travel through these devices. Attackers target these devices by sending malicious data packets. It is imperative to detect these intrusions to provide secure and reliable service to the user. So, an effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is essential for the secure functioning of fog without compromising efficiency. In this paper, we propose a method (Auto-IF) for intrusion detection based on deep learning approach using Autoencoder (AE) and Isolation Forest (IF) for the fog environment. This approach targets only binary classification of the incoming packets as fog devices are more concerned about differentiating attack from normal packets in real-time. We validate the proposed method on the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset. Our technique of intrusion detection achieves a high accuracy rate of 95.4% as compared to many other state-of-art intrusion detection methods.

The IoT is leading to the development of advanced information services that will require large storage and computational power, as well as real-time processing capabilities. The integration of IoT with emerging technologies such as Fog Computing can complement these requirements with pervasive and cost-effective services capable of processing large-scale geo-distributed information. In any IoT application, communication availability is essential to deliver accurate and useful information, for instance, to take actions during dangerous situations, or to manage critical infrastructures. IoT components like gateways, also called Fog Nodes, face outstanding security challenges as the attack surface grows with the number of connected devices requesting communication services. These Fog nodes can be targeted by an attacker, preventing the nodes from delivering important information to the final users or to perform accurate automated actions. This paper introduces an Anomaly Behavior Analysis Methodology based on Artificial Neural Networks, to implement an adaptive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of detecting when a Fog node has been compromised, and then take the required actions to ensure communication availability. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach has the capability for characterizing the normal behavior of Fog Nodes despite its complexity due to the adaptive scheme, and also has the capability of detecting anomalies due to any kind of sources such as misuses, cyber-attacks or system glitches, with high detection rate and low false alarms.

The increasing number of various devices connected to IoT and their different protocols has led to growing volume of zero-day attacks. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its superiority in big data fields and cyber-security. Recently, DL has been used in cyber-attacks detection because of its capability of extracting and learning deep features of known attacks and detecting unknown attacks without the need for manual feature engineering. However, DL cannot be implemented on IoT devices with limited resources because it requires extensive computation, strong power and storage capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive attack detection framework of a distributed, robust, and high detection rate to detect several IoT cyber-attacks using DL. The proposed framework implements an attack detector on fog nodes because of its distributed nature, high computational capacity and proximity to edge devices. Six DL models are compared to identify the DL model with the best performance. All DL models are evaluated using five different datasets, each of which involves various attacks. Experiments show that the long short-term memory model outperforms the five other DL models. The proposed framework is effective in terms of response time and detection accuracy and can detect several types of cyber-attacks with 99.97 & x0025; detection rate and 99.96 & x0025; detection accuracy in binary classification and 99.65 & x0025; detection accuracy in multi-class classification.

The IoT will connect not only computers and mobile devices, but also wearable devices, smart buildings, smart cities, electrical grids, and automobiles just to name few.

Only there are few companies concentrating on Security measures implemented on Edge Node. Gartner estimates that by 2020, more than 25 percent of all enterprise attackers will make use of the Industrial IoT. As Cyber Security Threat is getting more important, it is essential to ensure protection of data both at rest and at motion. The reflex of Cyber Security in the Industrial IoT Domain is much more severe when compared to the Consumer IoT Segment. The new bottleneck in this are security services which employ computationally intensive software operations and system services [1]. Resilient services consume considerable resources in a design. When such measures are added to thwart security attacks, the resource requirements grow even more demanding. Since the standard IIoT Gateways and other sub devices are resource constrained in nature the conventional design for security services will not be applicable in this case. This paper proposes an intelligent architectural paradigm for the Constrained IIoT Gateways that can efficiently identify the Cyber-Attacks in the Industrial IoT domain.	[Kirupakar, J.; Shalinie, S.

However, as we create economies of scale for data aggregation and processing, we also create attractive targets for various adversaries. In this work we design a lightweight, probabilistic intrusion detection system, or PIDIoT. We design PIDIoT to use operational measurements from IoT devices, with lightweight hash functions and Bloom filters to perform fuzzy anomaly detection. We experiment with IoT devices operating in an isolated environment, and we show that we can detect over 90% of simulated attacks. While we do not propose PIDIoT as a comprehensive solution for IoT defense, we make a case for its use as part of a layered defense strategy.

However, broad adoption of edge computing solutions is still lagging behind. We posit that a significant factor contributing to this trend is related to the challenges in evaluating the trade-offs offered by edge computing and answering a simple question: Will the edge investments be offset with commensurate gains in performance metrics such as improved application responsiveness or lower backhaul bandwidth costs? Existing simulation tools, developed for cloud computing and networking research, require a large amount of effort to be applied to the edge computing space. Their native abstractions and interfaces pose limitations in how such frameworks can be extended to allow for characterization and analysis of diverse edge computing use cases. Moreover, as we demonstrate, they can be slow, taking days, to provide insights. To address this gap, we develop Castnet - a fast, extensible, and easy-to-use framework for evaluating the benefits of MEC for different edge deployment models, configuration and functions. We demonstrate that Castnet leads to significant gains in the time-to-insight, while achieving the same fidelity in the results as existing tools. We illustrate the utility of Castnet using two scenarios: investigation of the impact of edge storage capacity for edge-based content caches, and the impact of edge location for an edge-based intrusion detection service.

J	Yin, HS; Xue, MY; Xiao, YT; Xia, KJ; Yu, GF				Yin, Hongsheng; Xue, Mengyang; Xiao, Yuteng; Xia, Kaijian; Yu, Guofang			Intrusion Detection Classification Model on an Improved k-Dependence Bayesian Network	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						IDCM; KDBN; network security; virtual augmentation method		Edge computing extends traditional cloud services to the edge of the network, and the highly dynamic and heterogeneous environment at the edge of the network makes the network security situation facing severe challenges. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study and build a high-precision Intrusion Detection Classification Model (IDCM) for network security in the emerging edge computing mode. This paper studies an improved k-dependency Bayesian network (KDBN) structural model that can accurately describe the dependence relationships among system variables and reduce the complexity of the Bayesian network structure by reducing the directed edges of weak dependence. On this basis, this paper constructs an IDCM based on improved KDBN by introducing the maximum a posterior criterion and a virtual augmentation method for samples of small category. The experiments use the KDDCup99 (10%) intrusion detection data set for verification, which show that the IDCM based on improved KDBN has high efficiency, high detection accuracy and high stability, which optimally addresses the issues discussed in many references, such as low detection accuracy and poor stability, for small categories (U2R and R2L) in the KDDCup99 (10%) intrusion detection data set.

First, we introduce the vertical and horizontal computing structures in the extended IoT cloud where IoT devices, edge, fog, and cloud are integrated in a layered infrastructure. Then, we consider the issues and design a framework and accompanying mechanisms for performing trustworthy computing making use of the vertical IoT cloud structure to secure the IoT cloud in vertical and horizontal computation structures. Specifically, we discuss a general trustworthy computing pattern in the IoT cloud and use intrusion detection as an example to illustrate the idea, develop an advanced access control and policy definition model for highly dynamic IoT networks, and introduce an integrated data provenance and information control mechanism to assure the data integrity and secure the information flow for various computation patterns in the IoT cloud.

Fog and edge computing are becoming a solution to handle IoT traffic by moving time-sensitive processing to the edge of the network, while using the conventional cloud for historical analysis and long-term storage. Providing processing, storage, and network communication at the edge network are the aim of fog computing to reduce delay, network traffic, and decentralise computing. In this paper, we define a framework that realises fog computing that can be extended to install any service of choice. Our framework utilises fog nodes as an extension of the traditional switch to include processing, networking, and storage. The fog nodes act as local decision-making elements that interface with software-defined networking (SDN), to be able to push updates throughout the network. To test our framework, we develop an IP spoofing security application and ensure its correctness through multiple experiments.	[Modarresi, Amir; Gangadhar, Siddharth; Sterbenz, James P.
